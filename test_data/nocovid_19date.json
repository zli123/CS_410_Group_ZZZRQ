For the price (we paid $99/night for a single room), I think this place was a great value, given its cleanliness, friendly staff, attached restaurant/coffee shop, and great location within Downtown St. Pete. Keep in mind, the hotel is older, so the rooms are not modern in style and the bathroom is a bit on the small side. With these expectations, this boutique hotel is such a great find. The service was so friendly; upon check-in, we were greeted with a warm welcome and were given complementary water bottles. When we entered the room, we found it clean and cute. We spent a lot of time during our stay in the surrounding area, and the hotel was in a great location, just blocks from Central Ave (where there are great restaurants and shops) and close to Tropicana Field. Also, since we drove from Miami, we had our car, which we could park in the spacious parking lot for free. All in all, I highly recommend this place. I would love to return to St. Pete and would definitely consider staying at the Hollander again!", "date": "2018-08-05", "time": "15:50:34", "actual_yelp_score": 5.0}, {"user_id": "DIesfhai0GANfJYy4ce4LQ", "review_id": "4OVrYC768s-jPEQ5HGXxMg", "business_id": "8jXmNMrGJ2acUG1R-D5e6w", "review": "Food is fun and the atmosphere is great.

The Bobbie is delicious. The turkey is 100% real roasted turkey they make on the premises daily!  The Bobbie has turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, and mayo. I know. Sounds weird. But let me tell you, it's phenomenal!  The bread is fresh and soft, the stuffing tastes homemade, the turkey is tender and is NOT dry (as someone else said in another review), and the cranberry sauce really gives it a kick!  Only thing missing for a complete thanksgiving dinner is the mashed potatoes and gravy. My husband got the homemade meatball sub and said it was excellent. The sauce was like Grandma makes and the meatballs were better than any Italian restaurant around here. The portions are also large for the price. $4.99 gets you a 6\" sub stuffed with meats, cheese, and veggies. We both ate for under $13 with drinks.

She was in such a hurry we were unable to order much beyond alcohol. She was gone before I could even say \"and a water.\" The one appetizer we were able to order was great.  It's a small place with at least 3 other servers so there was no discernible reason for the drive-by service. After multiple attempts to order food we gave up and just asked for a cookie to-go with the bill. We realized we had no silverware at our B&B so we asked a different waitress if they had plastic utensils to take with us. She said she'd check and then walked past us about five times over the next several minutes as we stood awkwardly by the bar holding our cookie topped with rapidly melting ice cream. When we finally stopped her to see about the answer she said, \"oh, I thought you asked someone else,\" which was really strange considering she had looked me in the eye and gave what seemed to be an appropriate response to my original question. I feel bad for this place because the food and drinks are really good and the cooks and bartenders seem friendly and normal. The servers just make it such a difficult experience to exchange money for the items they sell that I'd never go back. And to be honest the \"cocktail lounge\" and camouflaged restroom come off as a bit tacky without any hint of irony.", "date": "2018-08-30", "time": "20:29:25", "actual_yelp_score": 3.0}, {"user_id": "VGPvzuPO2n2cCTAz9zFtCw", "review_id": "Avh11AJC8v9_590q9hqYlw", "business_id": "M6qDX8HZS7gOJ_pBOAih1g", "review": "My husband and I were expecting great things based on reviews, but were sadly disappointed.

That's exactly how it's listed on the menu, so instead of calling it an Arnold Palmer, I went with how it was listed.  The food was mediocre at best.  My sausage were cold - cooked, but like they'd been sitting too long.  And actually, when she brought it out, the bacon was on my plate and the sausage on my sisters.  And it looked like they'd originally had it the other way around and had switched them before bringing them out.  The multigrain pancakes my sister had tasted sour.

The appetizers were less than $5. You get quite a bit. We tried the beef nachos, roast beef sliders and potato skins. All were amazing. They had my favorite beer on bmdraft, The Revision. The appetizers filled all 3 of us up. Our server, Kerry, was hustling as it looked like she was handling the whole room besides the bartender. She can really multitask! We are sad that this pub is 40 miles from where we live but next time we are in Reno, we will definitely be going back as their did options look amazing, along with their prices!", "date": "2018-08-10", "time": "20:18:45", "actual_yelp_score": 5.0}, {"user_id": "cDjXqNokkfApNIcrQH5GIQ", "review_id": "gAQ_aUP8EZRa1t2uFpB0Yg", "business_id": "D27EbvHituEpaFli7itYUw", "review": "Worse than the last time.

Unassuming from the outside, this spot is festive and cute on the inside.

I ordered the Pad Seuw - big stir-fried noodles with broccoli, garlic, kale, egg, and chicken.

Never did I see objectifying pictures of bodies or photographs of pedophiles like the ones in Buca. Italy's ancient culture portrayed tasteful nude statues.

This place is nasty! It's not clean at all in fact our room was never cleaned until we checked out. We were visiting Nashville house hunting and it wasn't easy to get a hotel room due to an event being held. \n\nWe were there and so was a dog convention. So many dogs and all of them barked non stop when their owners left their rooms. \n\nOur neighbor was a real treat. And the sick thing is they had a baby in their room. LOUD sex and banging on the walls to the point it was making the headboards shake. 3am I finally went down to the desk and begged the guy to do something. Of course nothing he could do but offered to move my room. 3 am and we had a baby with us as well no thank you.\n\nOf course we were very pissed off so we did want to speak with a manager. None was available at night nor the next day because they had the day off..... How do you not have a manager on duty? \n\n\nThe place is a filthy mess. The pool area knocked you over with the overpowering smell of chlorine. The windows were so dirty you couldn't see out of them.

Everything was cooked perfectly and super tasty. I was surprised at the portion size as when you usually dine at a \"nice\" place it's usually more about presentation than portion.
