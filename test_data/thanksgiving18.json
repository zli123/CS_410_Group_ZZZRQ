I have to hyphenate because no other country has this type of cuisine, not even China. As far as I know. After living in Japan for three years it was sourly missed. I will leave out atmosphere and d\u00e9cor evaluations because, let's face it, it's fast food. Although, the lady behind the cash register was hilarious. She cared about one thing, getting your order as quickly as possible. She was not rude just overly expedient than normal. It was if she had 10 seconds to complete every individual order. Anyway, on to the food.\n\nWe had our food there at the restaurant. The tables were clean-ish. It took about 10-15 minutes for our order to be prepared before we had to go back up to the speed queens throne to retrieve our food. I guess she didn't have time to bring it to our table but like I said, it's fast food. At first glance I noticed that the takeout containers, without the top lid, were stuffed with food. That's a big plus so since I usually start with five stars on my evaluations and mark down from there, I have to mark up from five to six stars (don't worry it'll make since in a minute). \n\nI ordered the General Tso's chicken combo (fried rice and 1x egg roll/1x crab rangoon (CR). They have it listed on the menu as something spelled slightly different but I knew it would be the same. I've had this many times before and sometimes they use very low quality chicken but not here. The sauce was the perfect blend of sweet and spicy for this dish. I have to deduct a star (5 star) because the chicken was not as crispy as I like but it was good. The pork fried rice was average but a little dry. My wife ordered the seafood combo with large chunks of \"crab meat\" but the artificial taste made them inedible. I have to deduct another star (4 star) for the \"crab meat.\"   \n\nThe best part of the dish was the CR. Although I always opt to get CR instead of an egg roll whenever possible I also ordered an entire order of CR (4 piece) as a side. I was pleasantly surprised with how large these CR were. The wontons were crispy, a little chewy and not overly greasy. Probably the best CR I've had in a long time. This calls for another star to be added (5 star). Oh, if you go, make sure to get \"red sauce\" with your CR. It's 85 cents extra but it's worth it. \n\nI will definitely return.", "date": "2018-11-27", "time": "21:11:20", "actual_yelp_score": 5.0}, {"user_id": "NmWq8MYyckcaiSJS9nG8wg", "review_id": "6ZsOoqqZ3QLYxCZ2rclmQw", "business_id": "uNTT5JHQsL781H_v4A4LoA", "review": "The new owners are not doing a good job.

We got a lot of compliments on that. Guests loved it! Another thing was that he worked hard at remembering our bridal party's names. My matron of honor and I were both really impressed by that! It made taking the photos a lot more fun. He also stays ALL day. He doesn't put a time limit on the event. We loved that. Time limits can be stressful because you're trying to get all the photos done before they have to leave. All he asks is for a meal for him and his assistant. The last and biggest thing we loved was that he helped side step a problem. My dad forgot his tie, but before I could have a mini panic attack that we were out a tie, my mom came in and told me that the photographer offered his grey tie to my dad. His tie matched really well with the suits and it was perfect! It was very kind and caring of him to do that.

Everything is delicious that we had on this trip between my wife, daughter, and me: turtle soup, seafood gumbo, the bread they bring to the table, artisanal eggs benedict, eggs sardou, eggs hussarde, and of course the famous banana's foster.  I don't think you can go wrong with anything.

This place is seriously hit or miss and I desperately wanted to like it. First, I'm a bit offended that they charge for chips and salsa. Let me tell you why, it's a cultural thing. I don't care where you go in Mexico, in a sit down restaurant there is always something to munch on the table. It's hospitality, we do it to say thank you. Thank you for coming to our business/home. The corn tortillas fall apart! They're warmed up, but aren't properly cooked. The red rice, is usually chewy and hard. The fajitas are pretty good, the steak torta is decent. The enchiladas need to be called something else. They wrap some meat in a tortilla and slather the top with a little bit of sauce and a ton of American cheese. There is an art to enchiladas. They've completely missed the mark. Been here twice, won't be coming back.

I know my bbq and the first let down was no burnt ends on the menu. I was excited for the fried green tomatoes as well. I should have known this place was going to suck when they charge you for bread and its a damn dinner roll. The brisket sandwich I got was so fatty that it was half the sandwich, I cut off chunks of fat bigger than the meat. Her salad sucked so bad, it was a joke.Only thing I can say was good was the drinks. I liked my gf's paloma, and she liked the Moscow mule I ordered.  I would never go here for those drinks though, nothing else to eat or order to go with it. Stay away. Go to Pappys in the city, I don't have any interest in Pappy, just think its the best.

To be honest, the food was ok. It was like lunch and a show for the price, which this will focus on. \n\nWe were there around 1:45pm today, Sunday, and it was like opening day. People everywhere waiting for food, for seats to open up, everything.  Online order pickup, dine in pick up, the drink and cutlery station and the only trash can in the entire place was all within arms reach of the main counter which made for a lot of frustrated shuffling amongst customers and the staff. We ordered and found 2 bar stools facing the wall. While my wife kept a seat for me, I waited near the register for our order as employee April running the counter, who appeared to be the manager, was putting minimal effort into using her voice to call names for ready orders. The order screen has the option to put in your phone number to get a text when your order is ready, but we all know that's strictly for marketing purposes and I don't give out my number like that. Frankly, I find it unnecessary in a space that I could walk end to end in 10 seconds. Put in a PA system for when it's busy. \n\nWhile I waited for the food, about 25 minutes, I heard an employee come to who April and say \"we need arugula\", she was to go get it from the refrigerator and the employee said she didn't see any. No remedy attempt made that I heard while I continued to wait so I can only assume there were some unhappy folks who ordered a salad later. Also during this time, I saw 2 different patrons come to the counter to collect their order and pay cash and the same manager, seemingly very annoyed by the customers intent to pay, shrugged them off and told them that the computer system wasn't allowing them to take cash currently, almost in a \"tough sh*t\" tone, then sent them in there way with free food. That looked real good to the 15+ other customers standing around who had already paid with a card. When our order came up, I picked it up and there was only one fountain drink cup while we had ordered 2. I mentioned this to April and asked for a second cup. She told me \"there's only one on the order.\" As I was about to remind her I had just seen her send customers home with at least $60 in free food and I had clearly paid for 2 drinks, even though Honeygrow doesn't print you a receipt to combat the argument, she just slapped one down on the counter and walked away. \n\nPresentation is as important as taste and the taste at the KOP Honeygrow didn't make up for the poor presentation by the manager.", "date": "2018-11-05", "time": "03:21:10", "actual_yelp_score": 2.0}, {"user_id": "kYNAdzk9ofmaZYmTciYxCA", "review_id": "D8TpEL5R8CYl2z47LS9RtA", "business_id": "ExcFu7R8ATHczORJ4opEUA", "review": "A step above your average diner in terms of variety of dishes.
