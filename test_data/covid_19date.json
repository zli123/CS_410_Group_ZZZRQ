I was warned during my first appointment that not all the physicians were comfortable with VBACs. I decided to see what the next doctor said. At my next appointment I had a friendly physician who was very positive but did tell me that there are physicians who wouldn't feel comfortable with a VBAC. I asked how that would be handled at delivery and she explained that a shared delivery model  had been developed to decrease the rate of C-section at Abington Memorial and that a physician that is comfortable would be available. A shared delivery model means that all the OB physicians that cover the hospital take call and you won't necessarily even deliver with a physician from the practice, just so you are aware.  At my final appointment with the practice I was asked by a different physician when I wanted to schedule my C-section. I expressed a desire to attempt a TOLAC/VBAC and an induction if natural labor did not occur. I was told, \"If your cervix isn't favorable there is nothing we can do and we wouldn't attempt it.\" Further more, \"this baby needs to come out and you need to have a back up plan.\" The physician completely dismissed my questions and concerns. She put in orders for me to schedule a C-section. Additionally, I was handed a consent for the VBAC, if natural labor did occur. And was told, \"This is just some paperwork you need to fill out and bring back to your next appointment.\" A CONSENT. If you are not aware of the issue with that. An informed consent enables you to decide which treatments you do or do not want to receive. Also, informed consent allows you to make decisions with your healthcare provider. This collaborative decision-making process is an ethical and LEGAL obligation of healthcare providers. At 36 weeks I transferred my care to a practice that not only supports my desire for a TOLAC/VBAC but spent extensive time discussing my options if my cervix was not \"favorable.\" I can assure you ladies you have options. Advocate for yourself and do not accept less then what you feel comfortable with. This is your birth experience don't let ignorant physicians hijack it. As a registered nurse and informed patient I feel it's necessary to share my personal experience with other women desiring TOLAC/VBAC.", "date": "2020-08-19", "time": "09:17:29", "actual_yelp_score": 1.0}, {"user_id": "yfmR99QnyazUI0jeK0AKBQ", "review_id": "jFijIH9fOIOe5VsunyFh9Q", "business_id": "YgkX66irnC9Zo94xINR2aA", "review": "Del Taco is my favorite and this location was gross. 4 meals and 4 different people.

The SF cioppiano was ok, the mussels, clams & tiny scallops were good, the small shrimps were crunchy, the fish did not taste as fresh, it was supposed to have crab meat but we didn't see any.  Broth was adequate, the concoction came with 1 piece of credible garlic bread.  Upon request they also bring you soudough bread that came out piping hot.  \n\nOverall it a very convenient place to stop by for a bite, just be prepared to cough up a few denarius for average food.", "date": "2020-08-15", "time": "23:30:33", "actual_yelp_score": 3.0}, {"user_id": "E9qmqUReu8ICyI43DBVBxg", "review_id": "J9bpcd7aWKBwu7V82kpR-A", "business_id": "o_N7HiU3f6cVvrJAFrE43A", "review": "It was my first time having furniture professionally cleaned but after months of being home basically all day every day ....it felt necessary to do a refresh.

Neil, is one of the staff members, he was very informative and helped us throughout our visit there. At the end we were very happy with our choices. \nFast forward, a few months later, we received our lights this month, August. Yesterday, we set up our dinette lights. To our disappointment ,many of the Crystals were broken. So now we have to call the store and hope that they are able to replace them. So keeping our fingers crossed.

I ordered the chicken sandwich with cheese and a side of onion rings as well as the crispy chicken bowl with chix rice and a side of mild creamy sauce. \n\nYes, I, one person, ordered all that. I couldn't decide what I wanted. It's been a long week, okay?!\n\nThe sandwich was delicious. The chicken was still pretty crispy even for delivery and the pickle, cheese, lettuce, and onion game added some class, texture, and flavor. I had ordered the onion rings because why not and those could have been crispier but they were still good. I dipped a few in the mild creamy sauce.\n\nThe bowl was also pretty fantastic once I added that mild and creamy sauce in. I don't know what magic that sauce is made out of but I thought it was a great mix of heat and flavor. I'm not too sure about the partitioned takeout container because it made it difficult to mix it all together, but I got a couple solid bites of chicken, rice, vegetables, and sauce together before I fell into a food coma. I like the crisp on the chicken. The vegetables were more than just broccoli and carrots, which was fine by me. I love me some squash. Overall, not my favorite chicken bowl in the city (could use some more crunchy texture like some lettuce on the bottom maybe?) BUT still a solid contender.\n\nThe sandwich was definitely my favorite and I would totally order that again with some of that saaaaauce. I'm interested to try their wings sometime too and maybe some other sauces.

It exceeded my high expectations! The atmosphere, service, food and drinks were all fantastic!  The chef/owner himself came out to deliver each course. He was incredibly kind to us, and very passionate about ensuring each bite was cooked to perfection. The wine pairings were PERFECT and we actually went to the store today to pick up a few bottles! \n\nFirst course: burrata and roasted beets, with oranges and marcona almonds, with a balsamic and olive oil drizzle. Not a huge beet person but wow, they were delicious with the burrata. They were warm but not too soft, not too hard. \n\nSecond course: Scallops with corn and roasted tomato orzo.  The sweetness of the corn and tanginess of the roasted tomato in the orzo were the perfect compliment to the scallops which were cooked to perfection! The taste and texture of the scallops were amazing.  \n\nThird course: braised rabbit ragout. Ok so my husband and I originally asked to have this substituted...however once we got there and talked to Chef, we felt like we should try it. The dish was phenomenal! The sauce was to die for.\n\nFourth course: grilled hangar steak with truffle mushrooms, roasted potatoes and red wine demi glaze. This was the best hangar steak I've ever had. The sauce was mouthwatering. The wine pairing was on point - we went to the store the next day and got the chefs reco. \n\nDessert: balsamic strawberries, vanilla ice cream, warm delicious beignets - I was so full that I didn't want dessert but it was a perfect size and tasty!\n\nCheck out the photos attached to this review - if you think it looks amazing, you should make a reservation because the pictures do not do it justice!!

Management is aware and won't do anything about it. \n\n1) there is no such thing as social distancing or being 6 ft apart in an enclosed environment.  I was literally 6 inches away from the ppl behind us and 2 ft from the ppl next to us. \n2) management won't enforce anyone to wear a mask. Multiple ppl walked by our table without wearing a mask (also coughing) then I asked the manager to please enforce their own rules. Shockingly she said she said she wouldn't do that and let 3 ppl walk by without masks. \n3) cooks in the kitchen wear faces mask when it's convenient - expect to see masks not covering cooks' noses and your food being highly exposed to their aerosolized nose droplets\n4) no clear signage about having to wear a face make inside or not coming if you have COVID symptoms. Also they should be taking temperatures but they don't. \n\nOverall, really pathetic.
