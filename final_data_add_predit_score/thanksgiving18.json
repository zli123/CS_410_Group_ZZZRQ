I have to hyphenate because no other country has this type of cuisine, not even China. As far as I know. After living in Japan for three years it was sourly missed. I will leave out atmosphere and d\u00e9cor evaluations because, let's face it, it's fast food. Although, the lady behind the cash register was hilarious. She cared about one thing, getting your order as quickly as possible. She was not rude just overly expedient than normal. It was if she had 10 seconds to complete every individual order. Anyway, on to the food.\n\nWe had our food there at the restaurant. The tables were clean-ish. It took about 10-15 minutes for our order to be prepared before we had to go back up to the speed queens throne to retrieve our food. I guess she didn't have time to bring it to our table but like I said, it's fast food. At first glance I noticed that the takeout containers, without the top lid, were stuffed with food. That's a big plus so since I usually start with five stars on my evaluations and mark down from there, I have to mark up from five to six stars (don't worry it'll make since in a minute). \n\nI ordered the General Tso's chicken combo (fried rice and 1x egg roll/1x crab rangoon (CR). They have it listed on the menu as something spelled slightly different but I knew it would be the same. I've had this many times before and sometimes they use very low quality chicken but not here. The sauce was the perfect blend of sweet and spicy for this dish. I have to deduct a star (5 star) because the chicken was not as crispy as I like but it was good. The pork fried rice was average but a little dry. My wife ordered the seafood combo with large chunks of \"crab meat\" but the artificial taste made them inedible. I have to deduct another star (4 star) for the \"crab meat.\"   \n\nThe best part of the dish was the CR. Although I always opt to get CR instead of an egg roll whenever possible I also ordered an entire order of CR (4 piece) as a side. I was pleasantly surprised with how large these CR were. The wontons were crispy, a little chewy and not overly greasy. Probably the best CR I've had in a long time. This calls for another star to be added (5 star). Oh, if you go, make sure to get \"red sauce\" with your CR. It's 85 cents extra but it's worth it. \n\nI will definitely return."]], "date": "2018-11-27", "time": "21:11:20", "categories": "Chinese, Restaurants", "city": "Saint Louis", "state": "MO", "stars": 3.5, "business_review_count": 64, "predit_yelp_score": 1.9500000000000002, "actual_yelp_score": 5.0}, {"review_id": "6ZsOoqqZ3QLYxCZ2rclmQw", "user_id": "NmWq8MYyckcaiSJS9nG8wg", "business_id": "uNTT5JHQsL781H_v4A4LoA", "review": [["The new owners are not doing a good job.

To be honest, the food was ok. It was like lunch and a show for the price, which this will focus on. \n\nWe were there around 1:45pm today, Sunday, and it was like opening day. People everywhere waiting for food, for seats to open up, everything.  Online order pickup, dine in pick up, the drink and cutlery station and the only trash can in the entire place was all within arms reach of the main counter which made for a lot of frustrated shuffling amongst customers and the staff. We ordered and found 2 bar stools facing the wall. While my wife kept a seat for me, I waited near the register for our order as employee April running the counter, who appeared to be the manager, was putting minimal effort into using her voice to call names for ready orders. The order screen has the option to put in your phone number to get a text when your order is ready, but we all know that's strictly for marketing purposes and I don't give out my number like that. Frankly, I find it unnecessary in a space that I could walk end to end in 10 seconds. Put in a PA system for when it's busy. \n\nWhile I waited for the food, about 25 minutes, I heard an employee come to who April and say \"we need arugula\", she was to go get it from the refrigerator and the employee said she didn't see any. No remedy attempt made that I heard while I continued to wait so I can only assume there were some unhappy folks who ordered a salad later. Also during this time, I saw 2 different patrons come to the counter to collect their order and pay cash and the same manager, seemingly very annoyed by the customers intent to pay, shrugged them off and told them that the computer system wasn't allowing them to take cash currently, almost in a \"tough sh*t\" tone, then sent them in there way with free food. That looked real good to the 15+ other customers standing around who had already paid with a card. When our order came up, I picked it up and there was only one fountain drink cup while we had ordered 2. I mentioned this to April and asked for a second cup. She told me \"there's only one on the order.\" As I was about to remind her I had just seen her send customers home with at least $60 in free food and I had clearly paid for 2 drinks, even though Honeygrow doesn't print you a receipt to combat the argument, she just slapped one down on the counter and walked away. \n\nPresentation is as important as taste and the taste at the KOP Honeygrow didn't make up for the poor presentation by the manager."]], "date": "2018-11-05", "time": "03:21:10", "categories": "American (New), Restaurants, Vegetarian, Salad, Noodles, Vegan", "city": "King Of Prussia", "state": "PA", "stars": 3.5, "business_review_count": 159, "predit_yelp_score": 1.1, "actual_yelp_score": 2.0}, {"review_id": "D8TpEL5R8CYl2z47LS9RtA", "user_id": "kYNAdzk9ofmaZYmTciYxCA", "business_id": "ExcFu7R8ATHczORJ4opEUA", "review": [["A step above your average diner in terms of variety of dishes.

Same dish beef with broccoli, cheaper but inedible.    China King is so much better, my favorites are their beef with broccoli, house soup, crab ragoon, sweet and sour soup, trust me you can never go wrong ordering these dishes.   Not a fan of their egg rolls or sweat and sour anything but I have been spoiled by expecting pinapple and green peppers with the dish, just a suggestion China King as you do vegetables awfully well."]], "date": "2018-11-11", "time": "01:19:32", "categories": "Chinese, Restaurants", "city": "Saint Louis", "state": "MO", "stars": 3.5, "business_review_count": 64, "predit_yelp_score": 1.3, "actual_yelp_score": 5.0}]
