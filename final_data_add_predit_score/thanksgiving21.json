I have had really good experiences and then okay to really bad experiences. \n\nSome advice, no matter when you go, expect a wait to get your oil changed. Even if you go to get in line for when they open at 7:30am, there most likely will be someone there before you. Also, these are not 20 minute changes. They do take longer than oil places that just specifically change oil. They do have a nice waiting room with a coffee machine, a tv and wifi along with hightop tables for you to be able to work if need be. I have taken my computer with me several times. \n\nDuring one oil change the tech did not put my plug back in after doing the oil change so my oil just flowed right back out. While getting on US 19 all of a sudden my car totally froze up and turned off. Talk about scary because there was a ton of traffic all trying to get on 19 and it wasn't a good spot to break down (where is really). So I had to call a tow truck for my car to be taken all the way to Jim Browne in Tampa because my car has a warranty on it and they have to do the oil changes and work on it. Plus I was close to a Jiffy Lube and they were nice enough to come out and look at my car and confirm it was the oil plug. So tow truck costs all the way to Hillsboro from Pinellas and then a rental car because it was going to take them several days to fix all the damage their incompetence caused. I did talk to a manager about the situation and being refunded the costs and was told that they would submit everything to corporate for the refund. Well... during that process that person was fired and the new person new nothing of it. Thankfully, I always follow up via email and had the conversations to forward. After more back and forth I finally was able to get my refund in full. What a pain. \n\nMost of the time everything runs smoothly but at a slower pace than what I feel an oil change should take.

I take it to a Jeep dealership close to my house and when they try to contact the warranty company they're told the selling dealership has to provide a diagnostic code to authorize the work to be completed. I contact Mike back and he gives me his managers, Kendall's cell number. I contact Ken and get attitude because I called his personal cell. After getting the run around from Ken and team I'm stuck with Dayton having to perform the work on my Jeep. Basically if you get a warranty, you're limited to only taking it to Dayton to have it fixed because they wouldn't provide the diagnostic code for the other dealership to complete the work.

At this point I asked for  a refund of my deposit. No call back , no text, no response until 7am the next day which was simply a notice of refund.
