It's one of the better Italian/ pizza places around here. They used to have their own delivery drivers not too long ago, and now they use DoorDash and other delivery services instead, which I'm not a big fan of personally. I ordered an entree tonight that came with a salad, and my salad was open and dumped out in the bag. I was a little disappointed with the customer service when I called the restaurant and let them know, and they were not apologetic but instead the person on the phone just said \"the box was closed when I put it in there.\" Nothing was offered to me for the inconvenience and food I couldn't eat, and when you order through their online platform the order isn't on your doordash account to request a partial refund or anything. I had to ask them if I'd be able to get another salad next time or something, which is kind of ridiculous and they should have offered a replacement or a partial refund for not receiving a component of my entree at the very least. I probably will not order delivery from them again, but I may dine in.

In April, we were placed in a room with the IDEAL layout for someone recovering from surgery, with surgical drains still in place - so when I returned in November, I asked for a room of the same layout. \n\nI made the reservation on August 29, for 2 weeks, asking them to please place me in one of the rooms with that layout - and I called at least 7 times in the months leading up to checkin to ask. Each time I was told it wouldn't be an issue. I called the night before and was given the same answer - in fact, the employee went so far as to tell me that they were still empty. \n\nThen, I get there the next day at 3:45 (checkin is at 4:00) and I get told that all those rooms were given away before I got there. The front desk attendant (Karen) was very rude and obviously did not care that I had made the request so far in advance, involving such an extended stay. When I tried to ask if we could simply switch rooms once one of the others became available, she told me to check with her tomorrow. I was going to be in surgery starting the next morning, so I was trying to get it all straightened out for the person who was going to be helping me. However, when I called the front desk to ask how that would normally work out (hypothetically, do we move our belongings? when would we need to be there? etc) she actually told the employee who answered my call to tell me, \"You don't need to worry about moving your stuff anyway.\"  How do I know it was the same person? 1. I could hear her in the background. 2. I asked the poor young man if it was the same woman I spoke with in person earlier that evening and he confirmed it.\n\nAfter all that, while I was in surgery the next day and unable to assist with anything, I was told you did (after you were asked again) offer a move to one of the rooms I initially asked for, but you didn't make the process easy at all - and the person helping me has a prosthetic leg and couldn't deal with all of that on top of my medical issues.

At any rate, let's get started.  \n\nOverall, the aesthetics of the interior are very welcoming, warm, edgy, a bit on the dark side, but we enjoyed the scene. Very few people that night, so we thought we would get great service, not the case. The Host was cool, sat us quickly (reservation), and we looked over our menu(s). Matthew was our server. Really nice guy, and explained each menu well, and we started with a few drinks. For the record, the place had very few patrons, and we waited 10+ minutes for drinks. I've dined in South America, Spain, etc, so I'm ok with long waits, if that's the norm, but it's not the norm here, so we waited. \n\nDrinks were outstanding. I would come back for the drinks. We ordered our food, and our server asked how we'd like it to come out, and I requested it to be staggered, not many patrons, slow enjoyable evening. The dishes essentially came out on top of each other, not how I like to spend a night eating an anniversary dinner. Quality just wasn't there. Bone marrow, sub par, Charred Octopus (I love octopus) ashy and just lacking, foie gras dish was probably the winner of the \"hot starts\", as all the components worked well with each other. We did have a \"cold start\" beets and goat cheese, started out good, but something was overly tart about the dish, and the beets weren't roasted enough, way too firm.\n\nHad the Duck for the main course. Again, just ok. Had some strange cannoli cookie thing, doughy, and just out of place. So...\n\nThumbs up for the drinks!! Service, food, not so great. \n\nFood, all around was a miss. This restaurant is marketed/advertised as an innovative, trending hot new(ish) place to eat in Tampa. The shell might be there, but missing the inner workings.

Really glad someone recommended him!  \n\nI've always been impressed with how caring and thorough Dr. Donn is in terms of discussing the finding of the dental x-rays, suggested treatment and making sure everything is done properly the first time!\n\nBoth Holly and Dawn are exceptional Dental Hygienists!  Not only are they friendly and conversational, but they go out of their way to make sure that you're comfortable and answer any questions you have (Ditto for Dr. Donn himself!).\n\nWhat I also find extremely helpful is that you can schedule an early morning appointment during the week at 6 or 7 am, for example. so that you can get a cleaning or other work done without having to take a half-day or sick day from work.  \n\nKeep up the good work, Dr. Donn and all of the staff ..and Thanks for being there!  You are very much appreciated!"]], "date": "2019-11-28", "time": "14:12:43", "categories": "Dentists, Cosmetic Dentists, Pediatric Dentists, Periodontists, General Dentistry, Health & Medical", "city": "Cherry Hill", "state": "NJ", "stars": 4.0, "business_review_count": 23, "predit_yelp_score": 4.324999999999999, "actual_yelp_score": 5.0}, {"review_id": "FdcNxGTtuvAsXCruLfjDlw", "user_id": "a4EDXJqa6YvE0PpeA4T4Ow", "business_id": "5TSYMfTMdLvmgmKZkzKNnA", "review": [["We've been having a great experience working with Lindsay on in-home trainings. As first-time dog owners (aside from family dogs) she's been an invaluable resource of advice and guidance. We rescued a 4-yr-old pit bull mix who definitely has some baggage in terms of anxiety likely in relation to her abandonment and Lindsay is giving us all the tools to help our dog. Behavioral training is a long journey which can be frustrating and discouraging at times, but Lindsay does a fantastic job of keeping us positive and celebrating small achievements. We feel confident having her in our corner as we work to get our dog as comfortable and confident as possible in her new life."]], "date": "2019-12-03", "time": "14:51:52", "categories": "Pet Training, Pet Services, Pets", "city": "Philadelphia", "state": "PA", "stars": 5.0, "business_review_count": 24, "predit_yelp_score": 4.275, "actual_yelp_score": 5.0}]
