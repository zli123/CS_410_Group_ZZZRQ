They must have renovated during the quarantine because the wrap around bar as soon as we walked in was definitely new. Instead of sitting off to the side, we opted to get seated at the table. We ordered two drinks off the tap: Cigar City homemade apple cider and a porter, the Hawaiian one was out which was a bummer. Then we ordered my favorite appetizer, Korean yum yum chicken. I am not much for chicken wings but this one is so sweet and tangy tasty and of course, being Korean I have to support it even if it's not as spicy as I would like. My husband couldn't resist the Darth burger adorned in a lovely toasted black bun with chips drizzled in ranch sauce and I got best side salad ever (that was the name, not my personal opinion).. I was less impressed by the side salad with epic name, but I ordered a cup of soup du jour, which was roasted pepper with gouda, and THAT WAS THE WINNER. The soup made up for the cocky salad with delusions of grandiose. It was nicely roasted peppery but sweet, dense and well mixed in with smokiness of gouda. We had a pretty decent service with the bartenders. There were only two of them and it was getting quite busy. I ordered one more drink, the salted caramel old fashioned. And even though it was nice and sweet, I should have probably not ordered it because it was quite potent and I think possibly made with Whiskey rather than a Bourbon, which made a difference in the morning after for me. \nOverall, pretty decent and glad they accepted my CL Deal with no issues.

The only thing I wish it had was a bigger screen, were used to having a ginormous- almost IMAX- screen in Hawaii for regular screening on new movies but it's ok, the amazing seats make up for it.  We experienced great customer service when we mistook the screening of Pirates of Caribbean 5 and almost missed 30 minutes of the movie.  Since they moved the room around that day, there was confusion of where to go when we were already rushing to our seats after being 45 min late, the manager (I wish I got his name) made it right and giving us the 12pm showing at no fee.  It made the sucky day into a great day since Pirates of the Caribbean is one our favorite franchise.  I think it's worth upgrading to AMC membership for $15 a year because they don't charge you $3 every time you buy your tickets in advance.  We wish we knew that because we saw 10 movies since Nov and we made up the $15 annual fee already from the $3 fees we paid reserving our seats.  Will definitely do it next year, just depends how many movies we feel like watching.   It's a great movie theatre, a bit far of a drive from central Tampa therefore watching the movies before 12pm for the matinee price and reserving your seats for $3 is worth it for the type of seats you get.  It gets colder than usual theatre too but you can bring your own blanket and enjoy.

It is open, well designed, with bright clean areas. White and blue colors fill the room, it's really refreshing to take in. \n\nWe were very quickly greeted and seated by our server for the evening, his name is Jeffrey, who is an absolute gem. My fianc\u00e9 said that if we were ever to own a restaurant one day, that he would be the caliber of staff we would hire.\n\nHe works so efficiently, meaning that he works smart, not just hard. He has mastered the skill of preemptively providing service, because he fulfills  requests before guests even have to ask for it. He doesn't overdo it, the perfect amount of checking in and being present, that one feels very well taken care of, but not hounded. He really is an impressive server. \n\nI had white wine to start off with, the house Pinot Grigio and later switched over to Tito's and soda. \n\nOur food experience: \n\n*saganaki (which Jeffrey presented beautifully, flamb\u00e9 style, table side).\n\n*calamari which was perfectly seasoned, not \n\n*side Greek salad (I love cheese, and the chunk of feta which I took home with me was creamy and flavorful).\n\n* Gyro trio was very tasty \n\nWe ended up taking food home, which after eating today, I can confidently say is well worth the visit here! \n\nThe women's bathrooms are very clean, with a baby changing station and good lighting if you need to touch up your hair/makeup. \n\nThey have a hookah station on the premises, which I'm sure adds to the overall dining experience, because it's a pretty interactive thing for guests to park take in. \n\nI can't wait to come back on a Friday or Saturday evening, dressed up and ready to sample more from their extensive menu. We will definitely check out the inside bar, perhaps during happy hour one day. \n\nThank you Jeffrey for your fantastic service, we will be sure to ask for you by name when next come to visit."]], "date": "2021-07-05", "time": "20:02:26", "categories": "Restaurants, Mediterranean, Greek, Beer, Wine & Spirits, Food", "city": "Tampa", "state": "FL", "stars": 3.5, "business_review_count": 332, "predit_yelp_score": 4.550000000000001, "actual_yelp_score": 5.0}, {"review_id": "xe2WS4K8l2kW3xWnTOD1AA", "user_id": "PpVtxDCgWgtNJr1TJjlNEA", "business_id": "4wy0zuo-j7uOckJeoJw4uQ", "review": [["Poor customer service, long wait times due to employee issues and average bagels.

Because this is certainly one of the most unique ways to spend a day.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nI've never even remotely considered going sky-diving, for real. There is a zero percent chance I'll ever do it. And it's not because I think I would die... I actually fully trust the odds that everything would be a-okay, and that I even might really enjoy it after it's done. But I just cannot bring myself to get into a plane, go up in the air, and then jump into the atmosphere. Nope, never going to do it.\n\nBut a controlled environment with gigantic fans powering you up in the air? Sounds like a fun Sunday!\n\nAs he does most of the time, unless it's letting his family bully him into going to chain restaurants, Chris W really came through here. I probably wouldn't have gone through the trouble of actually visiting iFly, but he found a Groupon that allowed us to score quite a nice discount, and I was sold. \n\nIf you're a beginner, they tell you ahead of time that this will be somewhere north of an hour and a half long, and that you'll only be experiencing two minutes of actual pseudo sky diving action. I was kind of annoyed by that beforehand, but after actually experiencing it, I feel a lot differently.\n\nOnce you're inside the tunnel, time drastically slows down. On both of my runs, I felt like so much time had gone by, but I'd only used 20 seconds of my minute. You are concentrating so hard on following all of the instructions and keeping yourself balanced, all while kind of freaking out that you're floating on air. It's quite a different feeling.\n\nYou can opt-in for the high-fly, which I definitely recommend. About halfway through your second run, the instructor will take you about halfway up the tunnel several times. It's great because he/she does all the work and you just get to enjoy the ride. It's pretty surreal and makes the experience that much better.\n\nOnce you visit a few times, you can work on your skills and get better and better to the point where you can go back in without an instructor. It's definitely tempting, because at the end, our instructor went in and showed off his very impressive skills. Imagine someone literally being able to fly around like Superman, and that's what he did. \n\nThe only problem is that you will definitely drop some serious money to get to that status, and as much as I enjoyed it, I don't know that I would want to be on the hook for that much cash. But I could definitely see getting into it if I had a few more bucks to spare.\n\nThis really was a super cool experience and I'm so glad they built one in Tampa Bay!"]], "date": "2017-11-14", "time": "17:27:14", "categories": "Active Life, Skydiving", "city": "Tampa", "state": "FL", "stars": 4.5, "business_review_count": 79, "predit_yelp_score": 3.0749999999999997, "actual_yelp_score": 5.0}, {"review_id": "Jlw7-KhxsI8ogwqZZt1xkg", "user_id": "kIYnDGaUm6db9_xe762TiA", "business_id": "R_7IvtCqjLpcdZjAdyQYBQ", "review": [["Very smooth roller coaster with awesome boosters!

Seriously, they make the best Cuban sandwiches in town. We've (my husband and I) tried many others and even at the \"voted best Cubans\" restaurants, we weren't wowed until this place. The first time we visited, we thought we could each handle a 12\" Cuban. (Subway length, so couldn't be too much, right?) Well, it was too much. They automatically come with a drink and chips, so we managed the first half of the sandwich with the sides, but saved the rest for dinner! They make it just right - all the way with pickles and mustard and crusty bread and three meats. It was pressed into a dense sandwich that is filling and yummy.\n\nSo, the first visit was in July of 2013. When we moved here this month, we had to find the same place. It took a minute to remember where this was, but once we saw pics of the place, we knew this was it. Once again, it was great food. This time we shared a 12\" and a Devil Crab. Although the Devil Crab was good, it wasn't for us. It was hot and moist, but not the flavors I care for. However, they are very popular, so it must be good.\n\nOk. So they were shy of a 5 star review for one reason - disorganization. They're too small for the volume of customers and there is no rhyme or reason to where you are supposed to order, wait for, or pick up your meal (at least during peak lunch time). But, the staff is friendly and the owner (I think) asked my name when I was near the counter and knew who I was when my food came up - about 10-15 minutes later.\n\nIt is worth the cost (great deals) and the wait.
