There was people living in their cars and or very openly doing needle type drugs in their car, no security of any kind, and was just dirty. Wouldn't be surprised if my car gets broken into\nI've honestly stayed in better motel 6's.

I was hesitant to go at first because the last two sushi places that shared this location were less than stellar. I took a chance and boy was I pleasantly surprised! My husband and I went three times in the same week! The appetizers are great and the rice ratio on the rolls is exactly how I like it. I can see us going back again and again."]], "date": "2017-08-16", "time": "23:56:41", "categories": "Asian Fusion, Sushi Bars, Restaurants, Japanese", "city": "Reno", "state": "NV", "stars": 4.0, "business_review_count": 836, "predit_yelp_score": 3.775, "actual_yelp_score": 5.0}, {"review_id": "e47AijT5NWeZUtuSnJoVGQ", "user_id": "Gv-D2ODquTBrmYiPVzxDlg", "business_id": "JbasD9GrfJ7SeiiucoizTA", "review": [["I had been to Chuck E Cheese's in the late 80s and their sister company Showbiz Pizza for parties when I was a kid and remember it being dirty, run down, and the pizza served was really really bad.  So I was skeptical when my toddler received an invite to a party that was being held there.  But, seeing as it was not about my wishes and it was about toddlers getting their fun on, me and my boyfriend packed us up and attended.  First impressions, I didn't expect this place to be that crowded.  It was more than crowded - it was hoppin'.  Several birthday parties were going on at once, and additionally, there were several small family groups there for the afternoon.  After checking in at the front and getting our hand stamped, we made our way to our section and scoped the place.  Every game machine was well maintained and clean, the animatronics were in great shape and engaging, the staff was on point (extremely helpful, courteous, knowledgeable and professional), and the entire place was cheerful and upbeat.  I was surprised that the pizza was actually decent, along the lines of something you would get from Dominos or Pizza Hut.  There was also a wing platter that had different flavors of wings and dipping sauce.  I didn't get a chance to check out the salad bar, but I overheard people talking about it positively.  The only things I wish were better: there needs to be more space between tables so people can scoot back and get up from the table without bumping into another party, and the actual din and crowd got to me a bit - I'm used to more quieter venues.  All in all, I was very impressed, and we are already discussing doing my daughter's 3rd birthday party (already have plans for her 2nd coming up) there."]], "date": "2015-12-13", "time": "14:36:42", "categories": "Restaurants, Arts & Entertainment, Buffets, Arcades, Active Life, Indoor Playcentre, Pizza", "city": "Reno", "state": "NV", "stars": 3.0, "business_review_count": 56, "predit_yelp_score": 2.725, "actual_yelp_score": 4.0}, {"review_id": "HPSEZSGm02pxowtIyuA3pA", "user_id": "vby4QFI3tgyJMLdQxeCbTw", "business_id": "qrn9ARB1gyJgAULFEi1Z1w", "review": [["Staff was great.
