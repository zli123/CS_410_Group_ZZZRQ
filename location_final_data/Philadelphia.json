So technically, it's a 3-star Korean Restaurant.\n\nAlthough my preference is for real charcoal, dirty floors, and tin top tables with a bunch of ajumma's forcing food down your throat, for what it is, Miga is a good alternative to \"authentic\" Korean food.\n\nApparently open only for the past few months, it's BYOB until next week (according to our waiter).  We ordered two orders of galbi at $22 bucks an order  (horrifyingly close to NYC prices, but reasonable for the quantity provided), kimchi chigae (non-Korean dinner companion's request), and was provided a hae-mul (seafood) pajun (service!  woot woot!).  The galbi was cooked on an infrared electric stove top (with a charcoal log for flavor in the base - so we were told).  To be fair, it was surprisingly effective in grilling the meat - as I feared it might boil/steam as tends to be the case on electric stove tops.  A secondary plus with the electric grill was that it created far less smoke than a true charcoal or gas contraption.  This is obviously necessary at Miga, as they do not have the individual table vents.\n\nThe kimchi chigae had no teeth, but flavor-wise was passable.  It whiffed of that \"we're serving non-Koreans who might die from the spice\" flavor, but then again, it's kimchi chigae, hard to f*&^ that up.\n\nThe pajun was also passable - doesn't evoke thoughts of grandma's pancakes with a tin kettle of makoli, but then again, you're in the heart of Center City.\n\nBanchan was intriguingly varied and plentiful; always a key component of a good authentic Korean joint.  They even offered Ggae-jjang (spicy raw crab); but the offering was petite, to be kind.\n\nAs already indicated, it's a 3-Star Korean restaurant in Center City.  The quality of meat and quantity (two orders + some stew = good enough for 3 people), plus location earns it (fairly or not) an extra star."]], "date": "2009-09-21", "time": "15:51:08", "categories": "Restaurants, Korean", "city": "Philadelphia", "state": "PA", "stars": 3.0, "business_review_count": 179, "predit_yelp_score": 1.6750000000000003, "actual_yelp_score": 4.0}, {"review_id": "5vDN41-jCpls_RM7g0v7Tw", "user_id": "d7TKkDf_TJyitv6vHyhnqA", "business_id": "rLpW8LAQSM9ReTl5YAQLDg", "review": [["This is a great vet in a convenient location with extended hours.

The decor of the restaurant is very unique, the patterns are a little busy, but it is definitely memorable. The restaurant is very spacious and open. We were seated and ordered drinks right away (not alcoholic ones). For an appetizer, we ordered the arancini. The arancini was just ok, I have had much better arancini at other restaurants, so I probably wouldn't order that again. Even though this is an Italian restaurant, they sadly didn't give complimentary bread for the table. So we put in an order for some. I assume they charged us for it, but I forgot to check the receipt and see how much. For my entree, I ordered the seafood gnocchi which was amazing! The gnocchi was delicious and cooked perfectly. The seafood was octopus, shrimp and mussels and it had a good amount in it. I ate every last bite. My dining companions were also satisfied with their meals. Service was good without being overly intrusive, which I appreciate  when I'm not in a hurry. Prices I didn't think were bad for the city.
