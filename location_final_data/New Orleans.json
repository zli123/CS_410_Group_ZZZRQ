They do a nice job with a spa pedicure as well as a regular manicure.  \n\nMy last visit is the one that keeps me from rating it a 4.  I opted to do a gel manicure and I think they left my hands under the UV light for far too long.  I began to feel a burning sensation in my fingers.

I asked the lady if I was supposed to take them out or let them go another cycle and she said they could stay in.  I don't get gel nails very often but I thought you're only supposed to need 1 cycle (maybe 2 at the most).  Mine went 3 cycles for each hand and that's when the burning started.  Even they were a bit concerned.  \n\nIn the end, my nails were fine and the polish lasted the 2 weeks that it's supposed to, but the burning sensation was cause for concern.  Also, when I went back 2 weeks later to have the gel soaked off, I was charged $10.  I've had other salons do this service for $3 and one salon I know of even does it for free, so I was a bit shocked by the $10.  But they did do a bit more than those other salons that just have me soak my hands until it comes off.

But, I also like it when my wife dresses in cute clothes, and I especially like it when there's helpful sales staff that actually know what they're doing (read carefully: no disaffected teenagers smacking gum and surfing on their phones). The women at the Diva were clearly into their work and knowledgeable about their merchandise, and they immediately zeroed in on a few things that would work well with my wife's look and style. This isn't my first trip to a woman's clothing store, and I appreciate the skill and talent that goes into this sort of sales(wo)manship.\n\nI enjoyed sitting outside of the change room and contributing what I could to the discussion about which dress to buy, which bolero might look cute with it, appropriate footwear (which they conveniently sell in the neighboring shoe store), and even which lingerie might look cute under it (also conveniently sold in another neighboring Diva boutique). The woman helping us struck the right balance of pleasant, funny and witty, and it goes without saying that money was dispersed and merchandise brought home.\n\nI tip my hat to the Divas; they are stylish *and* professional and know how to run a clothing store, and that deserves to be commended."]], "date": "2015-03-12", "time": "03:06:14", "categories": "Lingerie, Used, Vintage & Consignment, Accessories, Children's Clothing, Shopping, Fashion, Women's Clothing", "city": "New Orleans", "state": "LA", "stars": 4.0, "business_review_count": 47, "predit_yelp_score": 4.95, "actual_yelp_score": 5.0}, {"review_id": "9rrgsxy38QzoFcYEe0mdpA", "user_id": "iOgAMYKJFZVhaK_TxoMCwA", "business_id": "xJGT-TKhhxzUtzOA7zWDow", "review": [["Really like the merchandise in this store, they always seem to have original stuff for guys.

Atchafalaya has a menu with enough creole food for people looking for a local experience, but also many other options for people who aren't.  Atchafalaya has two distinct personalities: Dinner here is a quietly impressive, elegant affair while brunch on the weekend is loud and boisterous with great music and an incomparable bloody mary bar.  Night time dining here is great for conversation where you really notice the eclectic art collection and the huge carved wooden tree on the wall.  During brunch, the music reverberates off the walls so it can be quite difficult to talk over the noise, but it's still a lot of fun.  This is a great place to take people who are visiting from out of town.  Whether I've taken people for dinner or brunch, all my visitors have been impressed and usually say it was their favourite dining experience while in NOLA.  \n\nI have had shrimp and grits more times than I can count in the South and I still think that Atchafalaya's are by far the best I've ever had.  Coquette's are good too, but don't have the depth of flavour of Atchafalaya's.  Their fried green tomatoes benefit from the addition of crab meat; this is a much more refined version than what you'll get at other places around town.  The Atchafalaya house salad was better than described, I was surprised at how good it was.  I wasn't impressed with the side order of vegetable risotto, it was a bit of a tasteless mush, not on par with the rest of the meal at all.  All of their fish dishes are excellent, I really can't think of another restaurant that has so many tasty fish options.  Although I personally don't eat red meat, my dining companions have all stated that their NY strip steak and the filet special are some of the best they've ever eaten.\n\nThis is one of the few places I've been to in NOLA where the food and the atmosphere are equally on par.  There are many beautiful old school places to eat in the French Quarter, but none of them have the exemplary food that Atchafalaya offers.  I can't recommend Atchafalaya highly enough.\n\nside note:  90 percent of the time the shrimp and grits excel, but occasionally they are inconsistent and taste a bit lackluster, I can only assume this is if the regular chef has a night off?"]], "date": "2014-08-08", "time": "16:46:25", "categories": "Seafood, Breakfast & Brunch, American (New), Bars, Southern, Restaurants, Cajun/Creole, Nightlife", "city": "New Orleans", "state": "LA", "stars": 4.5, "business_review_count": 2037, "predit_yelp_score": 3.525, "actual_yelp_score": 5.0}, {"review_id": "PBElL5TvK4rIM6CJjmMxgQ", "user_id": "P18y0k5ICH0_vbqXZjgyiA", "business_id": "ChlcxTEoWBQJXJ2Xb2vm5g", "review": [["Unmemorable is the best way to describe our evening. \n\nService- Mediocre.

They either forgot 2 oysters or it's poor presentation. Should be served with a few pieces of french bread for sopping up the butter sauce. \n\nEntrees- Disappointing\n\nShrimp and Grits- 2 shrimp had full peels left on them.
