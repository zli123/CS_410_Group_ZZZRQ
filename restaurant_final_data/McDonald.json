Which to me is a little weird... But thank goodness we had cash on us! After we told her that'd be fine, she came back over the intercom abruptly saying,  \"it's going to be about a 20 - 30 minute wait\", then clicked. There was no where for us to say \"OK\" or \"Thank you not to worry\". There was no where for us to go even if we didn't want to wait. You can't just bail when you're stuck in the line with cars in front and behind you... \n\nWe waited about 3 minutes for her to come back to us to get our order in, we looked over to the other line, line 1, and a man's voice comes over the speaker to the next car, \"Hi Welcome to McDonalds... only accepting cash..\" \"okay cool\" \"What can I get started for you?\" Hearing this THEN, seeing two cars go ahead of me through line 1, AFTER WAITING 15 MINUTES, I said \"Excuse me, m'am??
