The boy T.....was fired before he was able to quit.It's not right for white women to use our color to make false allegations against African-Americans  it's also not right  to use the judicial system to call people \"ghetto\" and claim the person threatened physical harm or file restraining orders against someone who spoke up for herself.My friend reached out to me for the video of the manager TABITHA yelling at the lady.
