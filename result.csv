Any time I order my specific drink, I have two customizations that are incredibly simple. It gets messed up occasionally because the baristas have a routine when making drinks and I get that. It happens. Normally, I'll let the barista know, they will hand me a new drink, and ask if I want to give the incorrect one to someone else. I always do to pay it forward cuz the drink is still good and who doesn't want a free Starbucks to make their day better. The barista originally asked if that's what I wanted to do and I said sure, she talks to her manager, and is like ummm I think I will just toss that one and takes the incorrect drink. It's not the end of the world, but it's just bad managerial skills. You would rather toss a drink that YOU made incorrectly to what I prefer, instead of letting me gift it to someone else to keep me from getting two?

The young lady accused a worker of disrespecting and lying on her as well as making an attempt to assassinate her character by accusing her of being banned from another location.The manager literally yelled and scolded the young lady.I cringed from discomfort.A few days later I went to the same location and overheard the same manager telling a customer about the incident.After the protest and murder of George Floyd and me realizing that I was no different then the manager because she decided to yell and behave unprofessional to someone who was African-American after I come to find out after speaking to a friend of mines who's a Politician as well as regular customer there  who actually decided to be a witness in the young lady lawsuit .He told me the lady actually made a complaint that caused a employee she recorded yelling and using profanities in front of children. The boy T.....was fired before he was able to quit.It's not right for white women to use our color to make false allegations against African-Americans  it's also not right  to use the judicial system to call people ""ghetto"" and claim the person threatened physical harm or file restraining orders against someone who spoke up for herself.My friend reached out to me for the video of the manager TABITHA yelling at the lady. I didn't want to get involved in this lawsuit until I found out the manager included officers names in her restraining order that never answered or recieved a call for a disturbance involving the African-American lady.I am sickened at Starbucks staff as a company for their continual abuse of African-American people.The young lady handled it the right way .My friend has worked with the lady and her non profit .At no point should any customer be yelled at then expected to shut up and be quiet or get threatened with having a police report that was never filed and a restraining order filled with racial slurs ""I am from the ghetto I will beat you up."" I was shocked that Tabitha actually had the courage to include Clayton police names in her restraining order but ,I have turned over my recording of the incident to the young lady's attorneys in Clayton.Noone deseves to have pictures from their surveillance cameras given to an investigator to be shown to other employees at other Starbucks. They clearly wanted her to be intimidated for speaking up .Starbucks BLACK LIVES MATTER AND THAT'S COMING FROM A PROFESSIONAL WHITE WOMAN WHO IS SICK OF THE HATE TRAIN AND SICKENED AFTER BEING CONTACTED BY MY FRIEND AND READING WHAT THE MANAGER WROTE ABOUT A WOMAN OF COLOR WHO RUNS A NON PROFIT,THAT CLEARLY STATES SHE GREW UP POOR BUT GRADUATED FROM A PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITY IN ATLANTA .ENOUGH IS ENOUGH .I wouldn't be shocked if the staff go track me down to file  restraining order on me for recording the argument.Nice try ..I will see your staff in civil court to testify along with two former employees who are African-American and claimed Tabitha and Amy bullied them.God bless everyone .All people have a right to speak up.I hope she wins millions",2020-09-02,18:28:06,"Restaurants, Cafes, Coffee & Tea, Food",Clayton,MO,3.5,35,1.1,1

The staff at the new ""improved"" Starbucks are sweet, but highly inexperienced. It's a bit of an issue when you're paying $7 once or twice a day for a beverage and it is not hot enough or not cold enough. They do not understand how to use their $12,000 espresso machine properly. They don't time their shots. They have no sense of how humidity affects the grind/tamp.

I'm not going to harass the 18 year old barista to re-make a drink three times when they clearly haven't received adequate training. I have thrown my drinks away the last two times I went because they were not enjoyable at all. I plan not to go back even though I live and work within a three mile radius of this Starbucks.

I know to some, it may sound like I am being some kind of coffee elitist, but this is not Dunkin' Donuts. Starbucks have built their reputation on making coffee and espresso drinks and they rightfully charge more money for their product. But, if they do not know how to craft and serve their product, there is no point.  Clearly, they aspire to be the Arby's of the coffee world because they do not train their workers on the basic chemistry of building drinks. For this quality of beverage, I find the Dunkin' Donuts much better. The staff there is well trained in what they do.

What makes it different - it's clean and a good size (not too crowded) and the staff is friendly.

There's another Starbucks a block away on Walnut but it's usually more crowded (although the Walnut Starbucks is more convenient for grabbing drinks in between classes).

Food: Delicious!! We had the crab claws and chargrilled oysters for apps, and the Fish Pontchartrain, Grilled Shrimp and 1/2 Fish 1/2 Shrimp entrees.

The chargrilled oysters were good, but they were on the small side, like baby oysters. Again, I prefer Neyow's or Drago's version. What really shined were the entrees. The fried fish was very tender, delicately fried and well-seasoned. The shrimp, fried and grilled, were on point. The hush puppies were fluffy, plentiful and tasty. I don't know how my daughter's fries tasted, but my son enjoyed his sweet potato fries. 

Service: Our server Jade was very friendly, but not as attentive as we would've liked. For example, a table that were sat after us received their chargrilled oysters earlier than we did.

The oyster bar area was a bit narrow for a lot of food, but the food comes out one at a time so you can finish each dish as they come out before the next dish comes. Also your server is the same person shucking oysters and its amazing to see them shuck oysters at lightning speed while still remembering your order.
Raw oysters - Just about the same as any other oyster joint in New Orleans. Pricing was about average also.
Chargrilled oysters - Super delicious. They give you bread on side too so that you can suck up all the yummy juice in the end and eat it.
1/2 Fish 1/2 Oyster platter - Deep fried perfectly. By this time, we were both really full and couldn't eat any more, but we still managed to finish half the platter.

Nothing fancy but everything was pretty fresh and tasted great.  This is owing to the fact that they have a lot of turn over so nothing that can degrade with being out sits for too long, and the fact they have a simple assemble to order system and there's very little skill required to build a burrito or a bowl.  However this type of fast food relies on each individual component to function as intended or it ruins the whole meal.  Today the part that failed was the rice both white and brown.  The white rice was about 80% uncooked while the brown rice was about 40% uncooked.  This is absolutely unforgivable.  Rice is one of the easiest things to make on an commercial/restaurant scale.! I know, my family has done Chinese and a sushi commercially in the past.  And for a place like chipotle you have to imagine they have a recipe for everything including the rice.  I was barely able to choke my food down but I was too hungry to send it back.  This is an epic fail for such a menu!  No wonder chipotle stock is down from 700 to 300.  Additionally the chips were so salty that they were also almost inedible.  Quality control guys!  Come on.  Get your head in the game.

The time before that a whole meal was missing. They also never honor the request for light/normal/extra, ask for extra salsa...don't get it.

Chipotle is not unlike any of the other burrito counter service joints.  You walk up to the counter, tell them what type of dish you'd like (tacos, burrito, salad, bowl, etc) and then you proceed down the line to tell them the ingredients.  It's a pretty successful business model and one that's used in at least 3 other burrito places that I know of.

In other words, Chipotle is not special and really isn't doing anything any better than others with the same model.  The food is decent and the service is exactly what you'd expect form a fast food joint like this.  Where they fail is on price and meal deals.

Some of the other similar burrito places offer a free salsa bar and chips are included with your meal.  This is a standard at most Mexican restaurants.  For some reason, Chipotle thinks they are special and charges extra for chips and even more for salsa.  Yet, the price for just your main entree item is the same as what other places charge for the entree, chips, and salsa.

Like I said, the food is decent, but the prices stink.  For that reason, I choose to take my business elsewhere.  The dining area is nice with contemporary styling and it was very clean, so that's a plus.  With so many other options that offer lower prices, equal food quality, and free salsa; I just can't justify another visit.",2013-03-29,16:07:50,"Mexican, Restaurants, Fast Food",Brentwood,TN,2.5,77,2.7,2

I've ordered twice through the app and both times I've had to wait thirty minutes to an hour past the supposed pickup time outside of the store to get my food. Also this is chipotle, all the food is cooked, it just needs to be assembled. The system is bonkers, they make you wait for an employee to come out who you then have to flag down so they can take your name and then eventually start your order. The first time they were only accepting online orders because they were short staffed and COVID precautions, both of which are understandable, however it seems so strange to not just start the orders as they come in. The second time I came they were allowing people in and they served them immediately, pushing aside all online orders, even if you had put in a name. They also won't let you pick it up in store, despite the directions on the chipotle app. You instead have to wait for whenever an employee collects enough orders to bring them out, so they sit and get cold before it even gets to you. When you're letting people in to order, why can't people come in to pick up their food, you have the shelf for it already? Again, the food is fine but given how many people order takeout they should improve the pickup system. If you can't be ready for a pickup until and hour after I've ordered, make that clear ahead of time and don't give me the option to pick up fifteen minutes after ordering if you can't fulfill that.",2020-08-28,01:19:52,"Fast Food, Mexican, Restaurants, Salad",Philadelphia,PA,2,56,1.675,2

When they get to the ""wrapping the burrito"" part of the human conveyer belt, they will tear the tortilla. Considering that these burritos have the breadth and stature of a premature newborn, this is understandable and almost expected.

What annoys me though is that the employees at this location will carelessly tear apart the burrito, then check to see if you didn't notice so that they can just wrap it up and let you deal with the mayhem after you get home. After creating a tear that a car could drive through (hyperbole) one employee asked me, ""you think you can still eat it or do I have to grab another tortilla?"" No, let me just grab a fork because of the inconvenience I've caused you. It's not like I'm paying for it or anything...

So basically, keep an eye on them when they're making your food. They are after all college students who could give a rat's *ss if you end up with a burrito that you can (or can't) contain with your two hands. Promptly call them out when they try to hide their mistakes and then your dining experience can only be ruined by your own incompetence as opposed to theirs.",2011-03-05,03:58:28,"Fast Food, Food, Restaurants, Mexican",Philadelphia,PA,2.5,146,0.025,3

Be careful when asking for sour cream here - there was easily as much sour cream as there was of everything else combined!

Then, we were charged for a chicken burrito we didn't order or receive. When we asked for the refund, there was quite a bit of rudeness and eye-rolling.

The manager is the absolute rudest person I've ever met with no understanding of what professionalism is. Now for the hotel room, let me list all that's wrong:

-The cleanliness (our socks got black dirt markings just from walking on the carpet, the wash rags clearly have stains on them, and you can see soot marks on the base boards
-The hotel is off balance and has multiple high/low points (We had a glass table in our room, I put my lip liner and some other pencil type items on the table and they immediately fell off. 
-The shower drain is plugged (We arrived yesterday, and hadn't taken showers or touched the shower till that evening so we know it wasn't somehow our doing)
-The AC is disproportionate to the room and doesn't reach the other half of the room
-The walls are PAPER thin(I could hear my wallmates entire drunken conversation)
-Parking is on the other block and whereas that isn't my issue, the ghettoness of this parking structure was. There was people living in their cars and or very openly doing needle type drugs in their car, no security of any kind, and was just dirty. Wouldn't be surprised if my car gets broken into
I've honestly stayed in better motel 6's. The hotel itself looks pretty but when you add up all the negatives and that managers inappropriate behavior it's honestly not worth it. My advice is to just pay the little extra and go stay at the casino hotels. At least their parking is in the same building.",2021-10-23,15:09:12,"Resorts, Hotels & Travel",Reno,NV,2,13,0.675,1

We ordered the black bean burger and the double edge paleo bowl. Both very good. The aioli, that came with the burger, was delicious. I'm not sure if it is made of yogurt or something else. The cilantro lime dressing with the burger's side salad was also good. The paleo double edge came with perfectly cooked tri-tip. Now I have a go to spot if I want to get my veggie on! There were many items on the menu that I wanted try, so I will definitely be back. Oh and there was the tumeric latte. It was interesting and I enjoyed it, but I probably wouldn't order it again.

And it is always a treat to find somewhere that serves my favorite meals from Germany! The decor is outdated... extremely... but that adds to the charm for me.

Even decided to join in when they played the Chicken Dance! 
If you've never experienced authentic german food than this may be a surprise for you. I definitely think it is an acquired taste.  The prices were a little high, but where else are you going to go for Jaegerschnitzel? Things worth trying: Jaegerschnitzel. Its breaded and fried veal and it was delicious here! Also there potato pancakes are spot on!  I had the Saurbrauten which is like thinly sliced (beef I think?) and topped with a sour gravy.  The gravy was a little sour than I like it, but I think it was cooked true to the style, just not so much my style.  And I am usually a huge fan of red cabbage, but this one was a little too sour for me as well.  Spaetzle was great!!
Looking for a beer to rinse it all down with? Franzikhaner is my favorite! A wonderful unfiltered wheat beer! The services was ok.  Although friendly, he seemed very forgetful as we had to remind him on numerous occasions after requesting another drink or more water, etc.

First of all, it seems to be a magnet for hobos, lunatics, alcoholics, and the general scum of Philadelphia.

Secondly, whatever you happen to order, there will be an issue with that particular item. Order a chicken sandwich? Chicken was delayed. Order a burger? Burgers are on hold. Ordered both? Someone took a dump in the french fries.

Thirdly, food sucks. Keep overfrying the nuggets. Jesus, can't even get nuggets right.

Fourthly, support staff is moronic. Hey lady, I'm trying to fill my drink, cap it, grab a straw, and then rush back to the counter to claim  my food. Do you think you could clean the floor in that region 30 seconds later?

Fifthly, they insist on collecting my receipt when I'm trying to pick up my order. I like to keep my receipts as personal records. Do enough people steal from this place to warrant such a practice?

Its a 24 hour location (drive thru only for late night)...Quality is the norm, which is to say good.  My only issue with this store is that they do not like to adhere to customary service hours for dinner and breakfast.  To clarify, the nighttime transition to breakfast from dinner selections can and do occur on a whim, and that whim is usually the 19 year-old punk serving as the crew chief that night.  

Usually due to cleaning up after dinner, then after prepping the breakfast items earlier than normal, they will just start to serve breakfast rather than having to re-open and re-prep dinner supplies....and will just continue with breakfast thru to morning.  

According to McDonalds, their ""breakfast-after-midnight"" program was implemented to offer breakfast items along with dinner items until a certain hour...usually 2am...or sometimes 430am....however this store has at times I have visited stopped serving hamburgers at 11pm...and was on the breakfast menu....thats absurd.  

I've email chatted with Cathy the manager here to let her know what was going on, but have not been back since that exchange.  Not due to the issues, but just haven't been back....no real reason other than avoiding fast food as much as I can.  My normal trips here usually occur after midnight, perhaps traveling back from a friends house late at night and hungry for a snack.

We were then directed by a sign on the door to enter through the door that DIDN'T have the broken glass.

The inside of the building was closed, so we proceeded through the drive-thru. There were about 6 cars ahead of us. We didn't move for 20 minutes. AT MC DONALDS. IN TUCSON. LIKE WHAT?

 As soon as we got to the kiosk, there were two lines to choose from. Line 1 and Line 2, we went to line two, furthest from the building and waited for the person on the headset to take our order. We hear a girl say, with a deep sigh, ""Welcome to McDonalds, so umm just to let you guys know we only are accepting cash"" ... Weird flex, but ok. Seems like this location only takes cash? Which to me is a little weird... But thank goodness we had cash on us! After we told her that'd be fine, she came back over the intercom abruptly saying,  ""it's going to be about a 20 - 30 minute wait"", then clicked. There was no where for us to say ""OK"" or ""Thank you not to worry"". There was no where for us to go even if we didn't want to wait. You can't just bail when you're stuck in the line with cars in front and behind you... 

We waited about 3 minutes for her to come back to us to get our order in, we looked over to the other line, line 1, and a man's voice comes over the speaker to the next car, ""Hi Welcome to McDonalds... only accepting cash.."" ""okay cool"" ""What can I get started for you?"" Hearing this THEN, seeing two cars go ahead of me through line 1, AFTER WAITING 15 MINUTES, I said ""Excuse me, m'am?? M'AM?? Can anyone hear me back there?"" She came back on the intercom all frantic ""I SAID IT'S GOING TO BE 20 MINUTES""

The employee (female) told me that she doesn't have to get her manager and she is refusing me service.

That's fine sweetie. I didn't even want McDonald's but everyone else in the car did. 

The reason this place was so backed up was because she hadn't put the orders in and waited and waited. It's her own fault she was so frantic and behind in the first place. I have worked in the food industry to get a good grasp on how the ship is running. The way these employees and management handle situations are piss poor. 

Sadly, this isn't the first time it's happened to me at this location. The franchise owner is a disgrace to the golden arch. My friends have been yelled at here for the SAME EXACT SITUATION that happened to me. My friends have been yelled at because they went back up to the POS system and told them all the food was cold. The employee told them to eat their food faster, that it wasn't their fault.  Not to mention the food actually sucks. Sadly, when it's the only one that's open on your way home and you have cranky people in the car, you just got to give.

This particular location has the worst service I've ever gotten in ANY fast food restaurant... That's because of poor management! How do I know? Because when I've had an issue with an employee and asked to speak to a manager, they either didn't come to the counter or are worse than the employee

I tell him I am headed back up there and could he please make sure the order is right and the fries are fresh. Simple request, right? I get there sit in line get to the window and window opens its same guy from earlier who handed out my order out half done. He doesn't say hi, or sorry, just pull up and park. I say I'm waiting on my order. Again he says pull up and wait. I say I'm waiting at the window. I explain that I gave them the chance to do this right the first time and they managed to screw up 2 large fries so I was waiting at the window. He slams the window and walks away. Few minutes later he is back with a bag I assume is my order. So I roll down the window and start to hand him a half bag of fries and get my full bag of fries. Except he refuses to give me my food until he gets back the bag I have. Suddenly I'm the one who can't be trusted?

And that's why I am re-reviewing this place.  I can't let my old negative review stand in light of the improvements.

First, the location is no longer the nightmare it was.  The lay out is more open, cleaner, and generally better lit.  The counter works better, the wait is a little better.

The service is a little better, too.  New ownership is trying to create a new culture, and we'll see if that makes a difference.

I was warned during my first appointment that not all the physicians were comfortable with VBACs. I decided to see what the next doctor said. At my next appointment I had a friendly physician who was very positive but did tell me that there are physicians who wouldn't feel comfortable with a VBAC. I asked how that would be handled at delivery and she explained that a shared delivery model  had been developed to decrease the rate of C-section at Abington Memorial and that a physician that is comfortable would be available. A shared delivery model means that all the OB physicians that cover the hospital take call and you won't necessarily even deliver with a physician from the practice, just so you are aware.  At my final appointment with the practice I was asked by a different physician when I wanted to schedule my C-section. I expressed a desire to attempt a TOLAC/VBAC and an induction if natural labor did not occur. I was told, ""If your cervix isn't favorable there is nothing we can do and we wouldn't attempt it."" Further more, ""this baby needs to come out and you need to have a back up plan."" The physician completely dismissed my questions and concerns. She put in orders for me to schedule a C-section. Additionally, I was handed a consent for the VBAC, if natural labor did occur. And was told, ""This is just some paperwork you need to fill out and bring back to your next appointment."" A CONSENT. If you are not aware of the issue with that. An informed consent enables you to decide which treatments you do or do not want to receive. Also, informed consent allows you to make decisions with your healthcare provider. This collaborative decision-making process is an ethical and LEGAL obligation of healthcare providers. At 36 weeks I transferred my care to a practice that not only supports my desire for a TOLAC/VBAC but spent extensive time discussing my options if my cervix was not ""favorable."" I can assure you ladies you have options. Advocate for yourself and do not accept less then what you feel comfortable with. This is your birth experience don't let ignorant physicians hijack it. As a registered nurse and informed patient I feel it's necessary to share my personal experience with other women desiring TOLAC/VBAC.",2020-08-19,09:17:29,"Doctors, Health & Medical, Obstetricians & Gynecologists",Willow Grove,PA,2,41,1.85,1

If they never had the item in the first place, how and why are they providing tracking numbers for shipping? It appears that this company lists items on ebay and is having the items dropshipped to customers. The items are not actually in stock. Upon reading pages and pages of negative reviews, I see that other customers complain of the same problem. I will not do business with a company that fraudulently provides tracking numbers when they have not shipped the item because they do not have the item in stock.

I ordered the chicken sandwich with cheese and a side of onion rings as well as the crispy chicken bowl with chix rice and a side of mild creamy sauce. 

Yes, I, one person, ordered all that. I couldn't decide what I wanted. It's been a long week, okay?!

The sandwich was delicious. The chicken was still pretty crispy even for delivery and the pickle, cheese, lettuce, and onion game added some class, texture, and flavor. I had ordered the onion rings because why not and those could have been crispier but they were still good. I dipped a few in the mild creamy sauce.

The bowl was also pretty fantastic once I added that mild and creamy sauce in. I don't know what magic that sauce is made out of but I thought it was a great mix of heat and flavor. I'm not too sure about the partitioned takeout container because it made it difficult to mix it all together, but I got a couple solid bites of chicken, rice, vegetables, and sauce together before I fell into a food coma. I like the crisp on the chicken. The vegetables were more than just broccoli and carrots, which was fine by me. I love me some squash. Overall, not my favorite chicken bowl in the city (could use some more crunchy texture like some lettuce on the bottom maybe?) BUT still a solid contender.

The sandwich was definitely my favorite and I would totally order that again with some of that saaaaauce. I'm interested to try their wings sometime too and maybe some other sauces.

He was incredibly kind to us, and very passionate about ensuring each bite was cooked to perfection. The wine pairings were PERFECT and we actually went to the store today to pick up a few bottles! 

First course: burrata and roasted beets, with oranges and marcona almonds, with a balsamic and olive oil drizzle. Not a huge beet person but wow, they were delicious with the burrata. They were warm but not too soft, not too hard. 

Second course: Scallops with corn and roasted tomato orzo.  The sweetness of the corn and tanginess of the roasted tomato in the orzo were the perfect compliment to the scallops which were cooked to perfection! The taste and texture of the scallops were amazing.  

Third course: braised rabbit ragout. Ok so my husband and I originally asked to have this substituted...however once we got there and talked to Chef, we felt like we should try it. The dish was phenomenal! The sauce was to die for.

Fourth course: grilled hangar steak with truffle mushrooms, roasted potatoes and red wine demi glaze. This was the best hangar steak I've ever had. The sauce was mouthwatering. The wine pairing was on point - we went to the store the next day and got the chefs reco.

I was thoroughly disappointed to receive a tiny sliver of pie, the size you might serve to a young child. It was garnished with a raspberry sauce (very odd!)  and the taste was too tart. 
I normally love the slightly tart taste balanced with sweet, but there was no real sweetness to speak of here in the pie itself. 
Please improve on your pie portions and taste, and you will earn more stars.",2015-08-12,16:36:04,"Restaurants, Sports Bars, Nightlife, Bars, Pubs, Irish",Philadelphia,PA,3.5,301,3.525,3

When I booked my trip, a hotel closer to where I work was not available. I understand there was some sort of convention in town so almost every hotel was booked. I stayed in this area last time and knew it was a nice area -it is very close to the Philly airport. This was a very nice hotel -the rooms were modern and they offered a generous, free breakfast in the morning. The staff was great and there were no issues at all. I enjoyed my stay. However, just for logistics, I would prefer to stay downtown or closer to the facility where I work to avoid a long commute.

Unfortunately I didn't get to eat it as a sandwich because my bread was a soggy mess, even though I asked for the roll on the side. I'm guessing they don't care at all to read the comments/requests. Wedges were delish as well, super crunchy, and they give you a lot. Coleslaw left a lot to be desired. 

Now on to the beans. Let me just say that I love beans, in any shape or form and I eat beans almost everyday. I've had bbq beans, I've made them, I love them. These beans though, smh. They tasted like someone emptied bottles of bbq sauce in a pot, threw in the beans and onions, let them simmer, reduce, and accidentally burnt them. That then ends up a salty, burnt tasting thick, concentrated bbq sauce, with beans. Apparently they use sausage in there too, I didn't get any.

After checking out an event around Penns Landing that didn't quite live up to expectations, I passed Glory en route to a bus which might get me home.

More likely, it was my desire for a drink that got me to pop in.

Once inside, I went straight to the bar.  They have a great beer selection: local, seasonal, domestic, and international.  36 on tap!  For those like me missing Eulogy, Glory is a excellent substitute.

1cgtSTcwT_u-XTQywg9duw,pVgl2V9Oa6f1y3O3-JTr0w,Wkjt6DUTGX1zKpX0OnsvcQ,"I hate giving Korean restaurants over-ratings, but for the fact that it's in walking distance of my friend's apartment on Rittenhouse, it gains a star.  So technically, it's a 3-star Korean Restaurant.

Although my preference is for real charcoal, dirty floors, and tin top tables with a bunch of ajumma's forcing food down your throat, for what it is, Miga is a good alternative to ""authentic"" Korean food.

Apparently open only for the past few months, it's BYOB until next week (according to our waiter).  We ordered two orders of galbi at $22 bucks an order  (horrifyingly close to NYC prices, but reasonable for the quantity provided), kimchi chigae (non-Korean dinner companion's request), and was provided a hae-mul (seafood) pajun (service!  woot woot!).  The galbi was cooked on an infrared electric stove top (with a charcoal log for flavor in the base - so we were told).  To be fair, it was surprisingly effective in grilling the meat - as I feared it might boil/steam as tends to be the case on electric stove tops.  A secondary plus with the electric grill was that it created far less smoke than a true charcoal or gas contraption.  This is obviously necessary at Miga, as they do not have the individual table vents.

The kimchi chigae had no teeth, but flavor-wise was passable.  It whiffed of that ""we're serving non-Koreans who might die from the spice"" flavor, but then again, it's kimchi chigae, hard to f*&^ that up.

The pajun was also passable - doesn't evoke thoughts of grandma's pancakes with a tin kettle of makoli, but then again, you're in the heart of Center City.

Banchan was intriguingly varied and plentiful; always a key component of a good authentic Korean joint.  They even offered Ggae-jjang (spicy raw crab); but the offering was petite, to be kind.

As already indicated, it's a 3-Star Korean restaurant in Center City.  The quality of meat and quantity (two orders + some stew = good enough for 3 people), plus location earns it (fairly or not) an extra star.",2009-09-21,15:51:08,"Restaurants, Korean",Philadelphia,PA,3,179,2.825,4

They also helped me carry a bunch of heavy boxes of frames, even though I'd bought the frames elsewhere, and they kindly helped me wrap them up with string so they'd be easier to carry. This is the kind of mom-and-pop place where you can just tell that they are experienced craftsmen who take pride in their work and care about their customers.

It can be kinda confusing to find this place, you have to go upstairs outside to get to the actual restaurant. The restaurant was pretty busy at 6 PM on a weeknight, so I would guess you definitely need a reservation here. The decor of the restaurant is very unique, the patterns are a little busy, but it is definitely memorable. The restaurant is very spacious and open. We were seated and ordered drinks right away (not alcoholic ones). For an appetizer, we ordered the arancini. The arancini was just ok, I have had much better arancini at other restaurants, so I probably wouldn't order that again. Even though this is an Italian restaurant, they sadly didn't give complimentary bread for the table. So we put in an order for some. I assume they charged us for it, but I forgot to check the receipt and see how much. For my entree, I ordered the seafood gnocchi which was amazing! The gnocchi was delicious and cooked perfectly. The seafood was octopus, shrimp and mussels and it had a good amount in it. I ate every last bite. My dining companions were also satisfied with their meals. Service was good without being overly intrusive, which I appreciate  when I'm not in a hurry. Prices I didn't think were bad for the city.

One of the stranger things on the menu is the Chicken Frankie. I've never seen that anywhere in Philly, so I had to order it. My family is from Mumbai, so I'm quite familiar with the dish, and I can say this is not a frankie. (In my experience, a frankie is chunks of spicy, slightly tangy meat, wrapped up with chilies, onions, and chutney inside an egg-washed chapati.) Their version is shredded chicken in a stereotypical Indian curry, served with some slaw in a wrap. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but it certainly wasn't anything I consider a traditional frankie, and I'm not sure it belongs on a bar menu.

I love good street food, and there is no shame in that. You will see many stalls and small tents of both famous and big names, and small places. Some with long lines and others you won't have to wait at all. 

Every year I go I like everything I try, this year I had some fried dumplings from Humpty's Dumpling and they were good. I think some of the crowd read Melissa's tip and actually went to the sidewalk, people were everywhere. Also, too many children, infants, strollers, mobility scooters and pets. Just when you might think 9th Street couldn't get any more crowded, yet more people kept coming, either swaying or cursing their way. I thought I was Italian myself for a minute.

I think my eyes glazed over at all the options at the counter: pesto, mayo, cocktail sauce, ketchup, BBQ, ranch, harissa, mustard, pasta sauce, something arugula based; and then my eyes landed on something that was simply labeled ""Schwifty"". 

Mind you, this was the week McDonald's had released like 5 packets of their long discontinued goddamn Mulan Szechuan sauce for an entire country of Rick and Morty fans. In case you hadn't heard about it, it didn't go so great. My eyes lit up. 

I ended up speaking to the guy who makes the sauces and he told me it was his take on the McDonald's product. He looked up the ingredients and then tinkered, the result being something that tastes REALLY great! Sweet, spicy, tangy, similar to a teriyaki but so much better. And we did go to McDonalds and order some nuggets, and the nuggets were still gross, but his sauce really made them shine. I can't say what the McDonald's version tastes like, but this is delicious even without the hype or back story, just a solid product. 

Cook with it! I plan on using it on fried chicken. I don't think there are preservatives, I bought a bunch and froze it. The other sauces are great too, I also bought some harissa and their cocktail ketchup.

The staff here are always very nice. They genuinely seem to like taking my orders, allowing me to customize things (I hate sour cream and always ask them to take it off anything I order), and there always seems to be someone cleaning in the lobby area when we come in. These are all great things. 

That being said, the drive-thru often gives you the wrong order, partial orders, or they end up putting what seems like extra sour cream on things. When my fiance and I go, we always check the order as we're pulling out of the drive thru because we've failed to in the past and end up getting home missing half an order. Or we have some other person's order, which means they have my delicious Cantina bowl. 

Some of the policies are confusing here. They stop making certain things at certain times. No, I'm not talking about breakfast. I mean at 10pm they tell me they cannot make the Cantina bowl. No idea why this is a policy. But on two separate trips I was told at two separate times (one at 10pm, one at 7pm) that they cannot make a Cantina bowl at that time. Ok... confusing. Not sure why.

I placed my order without incident. The problems began after I paid for my order. I was told to drive around and that I would be brought my order. Okay. I only ordered 3 items. But I remember that when I worked at taco bell, this was done by some managers to keep our stats up. Okay, I can live with that. I drive around and join what soon becomes a drive-in theater's worth of cars.

I was the second of these cars, but the last to receive a bag. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Renija, the same woman who took my order, came out and asked us if our order was 4 Fiesta potatoes. It was not. I told her very clearly, that it was not. And she understood, I thought.

The bag I received was not what I ordered. The receipt inside was for, you guessed it, 4 fiesta potatoes. But the food inside was something completely different from either what I ordered or was shown on the receipt. So they had mixed up EVERYBODY'S order.

When I approached the door, I found it locked, even though the dining room is scheduled open. Soon, the same woman who had handed me my bag came to the door. I informed her that the bag that she had given me was not my order. She just looked disappointed for a moment. Then she asked me to come into her closed lobby.

And I stood in front of that counter for more than 10 minutes while this same woman went back to the drive-through. Another woman continued to mop the lobby behind me as I watched customer after customer come through the drive through, having their orders completed in normal time.

Finally, after another guy arrived at work and came to her window, only then did she remember my existence. She asks me what I ordered and I tell her. 

I swear to Zeus, she did every single itrm wrong. But she did throw a complementary cinnamon twists into my bag, so yay. (I hate cinnamon twists. It's like eating stale air.)

I asked for my receipt, because though I haven't done the review in years, I absolutely wanted to ""tell the bell"" about this experience. I am informed that she requires her manager to print me a receipt.

Enter, manager. A young, morbidly obese black woman walking to the drive through register, asking me if I remember how much my order was. Bear in mind, I had been charged for this order around 25 minutes ago. I did not. After about 5 minutes, she gave me the receipt and replaced my complementary stale air with an all ice Baja blast. The manager's mask clung protectively to the manager's chin as it had the entire time I'd been inside, leaving her fake-smile exposed.

When I went to swallow there was some big piece that felt a little sharp and flat lodged in my throat. I proceeded to try to cough it up or vomit but it was too late. I felt it slowly going down my esophagus. 

If i had to guess I would say there was a piece of plastic in my food that I had swallowed. I will never stop by this WAWA again.

- Turkish Coffee - Really bold flavor, great for coffee lovers who appreciate a strong coffee taste
- Earl Grey & Shortbread - Also had a pretty bold flavor (can definitely taste the earl grey), yet it was still light on the tongue since it's based on tea, which was a nice touch. Contains floral notes. I ordered this with the Turkish coffee but I'm not sure if I would do that again since both flavors were strong but in different ways if that makes any sense?

to get things up-and-running with freshly painted bright yellow walls, ""fun reggae music"" playing, a bright painting of Bob Marley on the wall and the delicious smell of BBQ as soon as we exited our car.  

Be sure to check out the picture of my ribs.  That massive serving was only $17.00.  I will get 3 meals from them.  I chose steamed cabbage and yellow rice as well.

We had a free Spicy Garlic Shrimp sandwich and Truffle Fries, so we decided to add two other sandwiches and another side: Thai BBQ Pork and Chicken Teriyaki Katsu with a side of the Sunomono (pickled cucumbers). All three sandwiches were toasted on delicious bread and stuffed perfectly. The Thai BBQ Pork had a pickled cucumbers, daikon, carrots, and Jalapenos. It had a great crunch and was a perfect blend of sweetness sand tanginess. This was my favorite out of the three!

We also enjoyed the Spicy Garlic Shrimp. It was similar to tempura shrimp with not too much batter (which I really like) and paired well with the arugula and sweet & spicy aioli. The Chicken Teriyaki Kastu was stuffed with a lot of lettuce and coleslaw and had a sweet sauce and much better than a typical fried chicken sandwich! 

The cucumber and fries were a nice side addition. I wasn't a huge fan of the truffle fries, but loved the Sunomono! It was sweet and tangy and went well with all sandwiches. We will definitely be back to try some other dishes (the ramen sounds good too :-)).

When I got there the next day the tech came to get him for his booster and I mentioned the eye and she told me that there was no way they could look at it since it was a appointment for a booster; to get his eye looked at I would need to make a separate appointment. I said if you could just look at his eye, I'm not asking you to do anything, just look into is high and make sure it's not scratched. She informed me again (kinda rudely) that that was some thing I would need to make a separate appointment for, and pay a separate exam fee for. I was pretty upset at that point but luckily the lady at the Front desk was really nice and gave me some suggestions of what I could do and what I could look for to make sure that nothing was scratched.

Sometimes I crave sweet red buns which they have - but I recommend getting their fresh baked red bean bun instead of the pre-packaged one that they also sell. When I took home the pre-packaged one, it just crumbled and was kind of hard when opening it. Choosing a red bean bun from the window display is a much better (and fresher) choice. Their Almond Taro buns are also awesome - not too sweet which is how I like it :) When I'm craving something savory, they have these breakfast egg and ham breads that are pretty tasty.

Some advice, no matter when you go, expect a wait to get your oil changed. Even if you go to get in line for when they open at 7:30am, there most likely will be someone there before you. Also, these are not 20 minute changes. They do take longer than oil places that just specifically change oil. They do have a nice waiting room with a coffee machine, a tv and wifi along with hightop tables for you to be able to work if need be. I have taken my computer with me several times. 

During one oil change the tech did not put my plug back in after doing the oil change so my oil just flowed right back out. While getting on US 19 all of a sudden my car totally froze up and turned off. Talk about scary because there was a ton of traffic all trying to get on 19 and it wasn't a good spot to break down (where is really). So I had to call a tow truck for my car to be taken all the way to Jim Browne in Tampa because my car has a warranty on it and they have to do the oil changes and work on it. Plus I was close to a Jiffy Lube and they were nice enough to come out and look at my car and confirm it was the oil plug. So tow truck costs all the way to Hillsboro from Pinellas and then a rental car because it was going to take them several days to fix all the damage their incompetence caused. I did talk to a manager about the situation and being refunded the costs and was told that they would submit everything to corporate for the refund. Well... during that process that person was fired and the new person new nothing of it. Thankfully, I always follow up via email and had the conversations to forward. After more back and forth I finally was able to get my refund in full. What a pain. 

Most of the time everything runs smoothly but at a slower pace than what I feel an oil change should take. My last trip I had a hour and a half wait.",2021-12-02,14:30:52,"Automotive, Auto Parts & Supplies, Car Dealers, Auto Repair",Tampa,FL,2.5,76,1.85,3

JPD8Wg7NSWS6zPGa5PNS5A,Bfduto0UkwQ6SpzRDfMhnA,xmOpIseR7tQwoOE5r5BxRA,"Found this gem through reviews on Yelp! Took my family for a night out to try something not very common - schnitzel! Easy to find with Google Maps. Good parking right infront but lots of signs to beware of where you park or risk towing. Friendly waitress seated us right away. For a Thursday night there was only 1 other couple there. We went at 6pm. Cool decor with a relaxed feel. Not exactly romantic but very relaxed and family friendly. The menu is extensive -  It took quite a while to make a decision with All the choices! 
One of us got the pepper, one of us got the one recommend on the menu - Jagerschitzel, and I really wanted to try the garlic butter so I went for the Prairie. 
Free salad was given quickly after ordering which was a great snack but quite tart for my taste. 
Our meal came in what I thought was a reasonable amount of time. 
The pepper one was exactly as described very pepper like. Not hot spicy but like you dumped the whole pepper shaker in. My friend loved it. 
My other friend liked their Jagerschitzel but I actually found the sauce too BBQ like instead of creamy. 
My Prairie was ...interesting with the Kraft processed cheese. Real peices of bacon! The garlic butter was frozen like a rock so difficult to spread and didn't add a lot to the dish in flavor.
Portions looked great but actually we didn't end up with any leftovers at all considering we all got full orders. 
The potato salad was loved by everyone. The potato croquettes were very good but soooo pricey. Paid an additional $5 to an already $25 dish for 5 deep fried mashed potato balls. Worth trying once but I don't think I'll get them again. Didn't seem to have a lot of other seasoning inside but very nice crispy and fluffy inside. 
I was out of water for quite a while before waitress came to refill but otherwise great service.

My wife put a deposit for a session with Gia in February of this year as a gift for our 20th wedding anniversary. I was very excited as we followed Gia from the time she was on ink masters through Ink masters Angels. I was re-scheduled three times over a period of seven months. Her booking assistant asked me what days work. When she finally gave me a date I took it, even though it was on a day that I said I couldn't do. I took a personal day from work so I could finally get my tattoo done. At 9:45 PM, the night before my tattoo session, Gia's booking assistant texted me that she couldn't make the appointment and could I reschedule for December 23rd.  At this point I asked for  a refund of my deposit. No call back , no text, no response until 7am the next day which was simply a notice of refund.

Our server passed by our table at least 5 times without acknowledging that we were even there.  Granted, he didn't have to stop and chat or see if we were ready to order - a ""Hi, how are you, I'll be right with you all"" would have sufficed.  Just so we knew that he knew we were there.  My friend had to call him over to order.  Once we had our food, our server never checked on us to see if our food was ok and didn't ask if we wanted the check, just brought it.

The food was so bland and tasteless that it made me want to call this a tourist place.  I had the namesake gumbo.  Now, it doesn't have to be spicy - it would have been fine at any spice level, as long as it had flavor.  The worst part was that the rice was underdone, to the point of it being crunchy.  Flavor or no flavor, that rice made the dish an epic fail.  The jambalaya that we ordered was done, but again, no flavor.

You can tell immediately that it's a family owned establishment and they are all hard workers and eager to please.  They do a nice job with a spa pedicure as well as a regular manicure.  

My last visit is the one that keeps me from rating it a 4.  I opted to do a gel manicure and I think they left my hands under the UV light for far too long.  I began to feel a burning sensation in my fingers.  It happened in both hands and that's never happened to me before.  The UV light is supposed to stay on for 1 minute and then it shuts off but then it restarts again.  I asked the lady if I was supposed to take them out or let them go another cycle and she said they could stay in.  I don't get gel nails very often but I thought you're only supposed to need 1 cycle (maybe 2 at the most).  Mine went 3 cycles for each hand and that's when the burning started.  Even they were a bit concerned.  

In the end, my nails were fine and the polish lasted the 2 weeks that it's supposed to, but the burning sensation was cause for concern.  Also, when I went back 2 weeks later to have the gel soaked off, I was charged $10.  I've had other salons do this service for $3 and one salon I know of even does it for free, so I was a bit shocked by the $10.  But they did do a bit more than those other salons that just have me soak my hands until it comes off.  They used the rotating file to scrape the polish loose and plus brushed some cuticle oil over the nails to help them heal - so I guess that's why the $10 charge.",2014-12-18,22:03:52,"Nail Salons, Beauty & Spas",New Orleans,LA,2.5,11,1.6,3

First, they charge $85 for an estimate.   That wouldn't be so bad because if you use the service, it will be taken off the bill.   However, the estimate was not complete.   I asked them to install a shower from the existing faucet and they didn't give me an estimate at first.   Then when I asked for it, they gave me an estimate to completely remove my tube and fit me with a new shower ($1200).   The cost to reset a toilet ($150).   That seems very unreasonable but was the only thing that I could use them on because the estimate had already cost me the $85.   The other problem was that the person that you talk to on the phone is not the person that actually does the work.   So the communication between them isn't so good.   The tried to call me before setting up an appointment to see if I was around to do the work.  I told them that I was out of the country and that my roommate would be their contact.   They just didn't have any work that day so they thought they would just ""drop by"".   Then when they did have an appointment, they had to cancel it because the job before mine went wrong and the plumber couldn't make it to the appointment.

I was with my wife for a few of her shopping trips, and I thought it would be fun to review the Diva from a dude's perspective.

Going into a women's clothing store is about as exciting for me as going into a gun store is for her. But, I also like it when my wife dresses in cute clothes, and I especially like it when there's helpful sales staff that actually know what they're doing (read carefully: no disaffected teenagers smacking gum and surfing on their phones). The women at the Diva were clearly into their work and knowledgeable about their merchandise, and they immediately zeroed in on a few things that would work well with my wife's look and style. This isn't my first trip to a woman's clothing store, and I appreciate the skill and talent that goes into this sort of sales(wo)manship.

I enjoyed sitting outside of the change room and contributing what I could to the discussion about which dress to buy, which bolero might look cute with it, appropriate footwear (which they conveniently sell in the neighboring shoe store), and even which lingerie might look cute under it (also conveniently sold in another neighboring Diva boutique). The woman helping us struck the right balance of pleasant, funny and witty, and it goes without saying that money was dispersed and merchandise brought home.

Everyone was super friendly and the older southern feel was extremely welcoming.  We split lots so we could get a taste for a few different things!  

We had the oyster and fennel soup which was really interesting because it had lots of fresh vegetables and I think tasso sausage which gave it a nice smokiness.  The soup was a little thin but not every soup has to be rich and super creamy.  We also split the baby greens salad with Hollygrove heirloom tomatoes, dijon vinaigrette and crispy little onion toppers.  The vinaigrette could have used just a little more umph but those crispy little onions - so magical!  Their batter has a bit of cornmeal so the little onions were super crispy and just different!  We got the fried chicken, pimento mac and cheese and greens to split and it was 1/2 of a chicken so we took leftovers home.  I am a connoisseur of fried chicken so I can be a bit judgey.  This chicken is so delicious because it's really juicy and their batter has flecks of cornmeal which really make the texture truly satisfying.  The mac and cheese and greens were both extremely good as well!  I ordered a fresh ginger ale and it was amazing because of the perfect carbonation, zing of ginger and little lime wedge!  I love hand crafted sodas!!!

iQwg1OWb8bytpoRnqlsBBA,faUidWZmyn3g6W6G7gy-bA,75FY8ZQx5nOWP0VFmNvWfw,"One of my favourite restaurants in New Orleans.  Atchafalaya has a menu with enough creole food for people looking for a local experience, but also many other options for people who aren't.  Atchafalaya has two distinct personalities: Dinner here is a quietly impressive, elegant affair while brunch on the weekend is loud and boisterous with great music and an incomparable bloody mary bar.  Night time dining here is great for conversation where you really notice the eclectic art collection and the huge carved wooden tree on the wall.  During brunch, the music reverberates off the walls so it can be quite difficult to talk over the noise, but it's still a lot of fun.  This is a great place to take people who are visiting from out of town.  Whether I've taken people for dinner or brunch, all my visitors have been impressed and usually say it was their favourite dining experience while in NOLA.  

I have had shrimp and grits more times than I can count in the South and I still think that Atchafalaya's are by far the best I've ever had.  Coquette's are good too, but don't have the depth of flavour of Atchafalaya's.  Their fried green tomatoes benefit from the addition of crab meat; this is a much more refined version than what you'll get at other places around town.  The Atchafalaya house salad was better than described, I was surprised at how good it was.  I wasn't impressed with the side order of vegetable risotto, it was a bit of a tasteless mush, not on par with the rest of the meal at all.  All of their fish dishes are excellent, I really can't think of another restaurant that has so many tasty fish options.  Although I personally don't eat red meat, my dining companions have all stated that their NY strip steak and the filet special are some of the best they've ever eaten.

This is one of the few places I've been to in NOLA where the food and the atmosphere are equally on par.  There are many beautiful old school places to eat in the French Quarter, but none of them have the exemplary food that Atchafalaya offers.  I can't recommend Atchafalaya highly enough.

Service- Mediocre. We were wedged in a table in the corner on the first floor and practically had to clear our table ourselves because it was hard for our waitress to reach each person. Our lead waitress didn't say too much, she didn't explain any specials without us prompting her. Little things like serving ladies first/taking orders were done out of order. Dining at this price point should have more refined service. 

Appetizers- Just ok

Miss Hay's Stuffed Chicken Wings- Were luke warm and boring. Chicken was chewy because it was getting cold and the stuffing was bland. 

Wood Oven Roasted Oysters- Tasted great but we were served 4 oysters in a 6 oyster dish (like a cast iron escargot dish) which seemed weird. They either forgot 2 oysters or it's poor presentation. Should be served with a few pieces of french bread for sopping up the butter sauce. 

Entrees- Disappointing

Shrimp and Grits- 2 shrimp had full peels left on them. I usually expect to peel my own shrimp for BBQ shrimp...but not shrimp and grits and not at a fancy-ish establishment. 

Garlic Crusted Drum- It tasted like it was breaded in ""shake and bake."" There was too much garlic topping and my cut of fish was so bad it almost looked like chicken. It was a very thick piece and I don't think it was cooked all the way through. It had a terrible blood line through it and was inedible. A waste of $31. I would have told the wait staff but no one checked on us until my party was finished with their entrees and at that point I was just over the entire thing.

2 Stars for atrocious service. Our server was non existent. It took 10 minutes for someone to greet us, or take drink orders. Finally after about a half hour we got our food order in (it was a prix fixe menu for Easter). I had to stop the waiter multiple times to ask for another drink or something of the like- instead of him checking in with us. I almost got up to ask who our server was, but the maitre d came by just in time-one of the only people who seemed to care about the customers. I could go on, but bottom line- awful service. To the point where it negatively affected my experience.  

If this were a casual, less expensive venue I wouldn't care, but this is supposed to be one of the premiere establishments in NOLA. To say the least, it didn't live up to the expectations. I may return based on the nice ambiance and great food, but there are tons of other venues that have both of these aspects-where customers are treated like they should be.

There are MANY great restaurants in NOLA, too many to choose from to squeeze into our short 5 days trip. We are glad that we didn't skip COCHON! 

We arrived around 9PM without a reservation and were able to get seated within 10 minutes. The restaurant was crowded (it was Thursday night), we got lucky to get seated fairly quickly! Love the decor, dim lighting, modern wooden chairs, beautiful place... great for dates!

We ordered the following:
Wood Fire Oyster Roast - came in 6 pieces, it was a bit on the salty side..nothing special
Fried Alligator with Chili garlic aioli - WOW yumm!!! certainly a fan.. it has the kick of spiciness and those novice alligator eaters, this taste like popcorn chicken..yumm!
Spicy grilled pork ribs with watermelon pickle - it is quiet spicy.. but we loveeee it!! the watermelon pickle is genius and the ribs ..fall off the bones!
Crawfish pie - looks like an empanada that was generously stuffed with rice and crawfish.. the pie crust was flaky and crispy..very yummy 

We couldn't decide on which dessert to share so we ordered both the Black Bottomed Brown Butter Banana Cream Pie, THE BEST BANANA CREAM PIE EVER!!!! and Butterscotch Pudding... the pudding was delicious BUT it wasn't that special.. we wanted a bit more texture.. wish they crumbled the some toffee for crunch.

With a couple glasses of beer.. our bill was about $70 before tip. It was not cheap.. and we were full..especially the desserts were very rich!!!

Everything was great except the bigotry we had to witness at the hostess desk when we arrived. An African American woman was turned away because she was wearing ""shorts"". Problem is, she wasn't wearing shorts. She was wearing a perfectly suitable dress according to the dress code with a short-ish skirt with, I assume, some type of short pant underneath. Truth be told, I was standing right there and couldn't actually see the ""shorts"". All I could see was a very modest dress with a high neck, long sleeves and a skirt with an asymmetrical hemline. If she had shorts on, it was to make the outfit even more modest. I was going to step in and help argue her position but her friends were doing a fine job without my help and I thought ""well, the dress code here must be very strictly enforced.""
However, when we entered the dining room we saw several old white men in short sleeves, one with what looked like a polo shirt, and lots of white women in revealing dresses with their butts and boobs hanging out. I saw a lot of of clothing I wouldn't think would pass the ""business attire"" dress code test. But, I guess it's ok to have white skin showing.

She cared about one thing, getting your order as quickly as possible. She was not rude just overly expedient than normal. It was if she had 10 seconds to complete every individual order. Anyway, on to the food.

We had our food there at the restaurant. The tables were clean-ish. It took about 10-15 minutes for our order to be prepared before we had to go back up to the speed queens throne to retrieve our food. I guess she didn't have time to bring it to our table but like I said, it's fast food. At first glance I noticed that the takeout containers, without the top lid, were stuffed with food. That's a big plus so since I usually start with five stars on my evaluations and mark down from there, I have to mark up from five to six stars (don't worry it'll make since in a minute). 

I ordered the General Tso's chicken combo (fried rice and 1x egg roll/1x crab rangoon (CR). They have it listed on the menu as something spelled slightly different but I knew it would be the same. I've had this many times before and sometimes they use very low quality chicken but not here. The sauce was the perfect blend of sweet and spicy for this dish. I have to deduct a star (5 star) because the chicken was not as crispy as I like but it was good. The pork fried rice was average but a little dry. My wife ordered the seafood combo with large chunks of ""crab meat"" but the artificial taste made them inedible. I have to deduct another star (4 star) for the ""crab meat.""   

The best part of the dish was the CR. Although I always opt to get CR instead of an egg roll whenever possible I also ordered an entire order of CR (4 piece) as a side. I was pleasantly surprised with how large these CR were. The wontons were crispy, a little chewy and not overly greasy. Probably the best CR I've had in a long time. This calls for another star to be added (5 star). Oh, if you go, make sure to get ""red sauce"" with your CR. It's 85 cents extra but it's worth it.

We found Garret on Facebook and we really liked the look of his work, so we had a meet with him. We met at a Starbucks and Garett was so easy to talk to. Super personable! He answered all of our questions and had some extra perks we liked. He was easily our favorite vendor throughout our wedding planning process! He is quick on response times and always willing to answer questions. 

Some things we personally loved that he did was at the reception he put up some of the photos he took throughout the wedding so our guests were able to see them! We got a lot of compliments on that. Guests loved it! Another thing was that he worked hard at remembering our bridal party's names. My matron of honor and I were both really impressed by that! It made taking the photos a lot more fun. He also stays ALL day. He doesn't put a time limit on the event. We loved that. Time limits can be stressful because you're trying to get all the photos done before they have to leave. All he asks is for a meal for him and his assistant. The last and biggest thing we loved was that he helped side step a problem. My dad forgot his tie, but before I could have a mini panic attack that we were out a tie, my mom came in and told me that the photographer offered his grey tie to my dad. His tie matched really well with the suits and it was perfect! It was very kind and caring of him to do that. My husband and I were really grateful!

We were there around 1:45pm today, Sunday, and it was like opening day. People everywhere waiting for food, for seats to open up, everything.  Online order pickup, dine in pick up, the drink and cutlery station and the only trash can in the entire place was all within arms reach of the main counter which made for a lot of frustrated shuffling amongst customers and the staff. We ordered and found 2 bar stools facing the wall. While my wife kept a seat for me, I waited near the register for our order as employee April running the counter, who appeared to be the manager, was putting minimal effort into using her voice to call names for ready orders. The order screen has the option to put in your phone number to get a text when your order is ready, but we all know that's strictly for marketing purposes and I don't give out my number like that. Frankly, I find it unnecessary in a space that I could walk end to end in 10 seconds. Put in a PA system for when it's busy. 

While I waited for the food, about 25 minutes, I heard an employee come to who April and say ""we need arugula"", she was to go get it from the refrigerator and the employee said she didn't see any. No remedy attempt made that I heard while I continued to wait so I can only assume there were some unhappy folks who ordered a salad later. Also during this time, I saw 2 different patrons come to the counter to collect their order and pay cash and the same manager, seemingly very annoyed by the customers intent to pay, shrugged them off and told them that the computer system wasn't allowing them to take cash currently, almost in a ""tough sh*t"" tone, then sent them in there way with free food. That looked real good to the 15+ other customers standing around who had already paid with a card. When our order came up, I picked it up and there was only one fountain drink cup while we had ordered 2. I mentioned this to April and asked for a second cup. She told me ""there's only one on the order."" As I was about to remind her I had just seen her send customers home with at least $60 in free food and I had clearly paid for 2 drinks, even though Honeygrow doesn't print you a receipt to combat the argument, she just slapped one down on the counter and walked away.

We have tried 2 locations in the area - the first one was an OK experience but we live closer to this location and thought we'd give it a try based on reviews we'd read. 

Our puppy is 3 months old and went in for vaccinations recently. The vet seemed very young and inexperienced. When asked about a medication, she had to go consult someone else. (Our first red flag). When they suggested de-worming, I brought up that she had already had many rounds (this was round 5) and the fecal exam didn't show any last time. (Second red flag) Then when it came time for shots, she injected into a bad location which caused our puppy immense pain that night and into the following day / evening. By the time we got her home, she had started yelping with walking, moving that leg / shoulder, when sleeping and changing positions she'd wake up and yelp and limped. I understand shots can cause a little soreness (just like in humans) but this was not a mild reaction. We have a good size dog (she's over 25lbs already) and was still, eating her peanut butter treat, during the shot. We used the vet chat after hours to get help and then next day when the follow up call came, we felt as though it was brushed off as  just ""something that happens"" with no offer to have her seen or any advice / apology. (Third red flag) 

We have already put in a request to cancel her puppy plan and change to a local vet, not nationwide chain. I'm sure there are a lot of great vets throughout this practice but in middle TN, we are not confident in their abilities.",2019-12-04,18:18:47,"Pets, Veterinarians",Smyrna,TN,2.5,6,0.8,2

I really should have read the reviews before trying this nail salon - my experience was absolutely HORRIBLE!

My daughter pointed out when we got to the car that one of her nails had already chipped...so back in we went to have it fixed (which they did).  This also gave me a moment to better inspect my own nails - they were horrible!  The paint was extremely thick and uneven, and one nail had been filed down to the quick.  It was late, and honestly, I didn't have time for my entire set to be removed and redone -I was willing to live with it.  However, after both my AND my daughter's freshly painted gel nails (which should last 2-3 weeks) chipped after 24 hours, I called the salon to both complain and request they either refund my money or repaint my nails.

I was pleasantly surprised that the owner called me, and after reviewing the pictures of our nails, offered to redo them for free the next weekend.

After reluctantly returning to West Nashville - and waiting an HOUR for them to soak off my nails, it was that thick - we left with newly polished gel nails and hoped for a better experience.

It is now the Wednesday - 4 days after our new polish - and my daughters nails are chipped up AGAIN.  Clearly, they are not using good product.

I might have given them 2 stars because the owner was amicable to rectifying the problem, but it really didn't solve the issue.

In April, we were placed in a room with the IDEAL layout for someone recovering from surgery, with surgical drains still in place - so when I returned in November, I asked for a room of the same layout. 

I made the reservation on August 29, for 2 weeks, asking them to please place me in one of the rooms with that layout - and I called at least 7 times in the months leading up to checkin to ask. Each time I was told it wouldn't be an issue. I called the night before and was given the same answer - in fact, the employee went so far as to tell me that they were still empty. 

Then, I get there the next day at 3:45 (checkin is at 4:00) and I get told that all those rooms were given away before I got there. The front desk attendant (Karen) was very rude and obviously did not care that I had made the request so far in advance, involving such an extended stay. When I tried to ask if we could simply switch rooms once one of the others became available, she told me to check with her tomorrow. I was going to be in surgery starting the next morning, so I was trying to get it all straightened out for the person who was going to be helping me. However, when I called the front desk to ask how that would normally work out (hypothetically, do we move our belongings? when would we need to be there? etc) she actually told the employee who answered my call to tell me, ""You don't need to worry about moving your stuff anyway.""  How do I know it was the same person? 1. I could hear her in the background. 2. I asked the poor young man if it was the same woman I spoke with in person earlier that evening and he confirmed it.

After all that, while I was in surgery the next day and unable to assist with anything, I was told you did (after you were asked again) offer a move to one of the rooms I initially asked for, but you didn't make the process easy at all - and the person helping me has a prosthetic leg and couldn't deal with all of that on top of my medical issues. He declined the move to preserve his own health (physical and mental at that point.) 

I will be returning to St Louis multiple times a year, for extended periods each time - but I will not be returning to this hotel.",2019-11-24,06:59:56,"Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel, Hotels",Saint Louis,MO,3.5,74,1.275,1

That doesn't mean that we expect more, it just means that we've experienced some really well made dishes, and just overall experiences. My wife and I were hopeful with Edison, with Chef Pierola, James Beard etc. Maybe she was out that night. At any rate, let's get started.  

Overall, the aesthetics of the interior are very welcoming, warm, edgy, a bit on the dark side, but we enjoyed the scene. Very few people that night, so we thought we would get great service, not the case. The Host was cool, sat us quickly (reservation), and we looked over our menu(s). Matthew was our server. Really nice guy, and explained each menu well, and we started with a few drinks. For the record, the place had very few patrons, and we waited 10+ minutes for drinks. I've dined in South America, Spain, etc, so I'm ok with long waits, if that's the norm, but it's not the norm here, so we waited. 

Drinks were outstanding. I would come back for the drinks. We ordered our food, and our server asked how we'd like it to come out, and I requested it to be staggered, not many patrons, slow enjoyable evening. The dishes essentially came out on top of each other, not how I like to spend a night eating an anniversary dinner. Quality just wasn't there. Bone marrow, sub par, Charred Octopus (I love octopus) ashy and just lacking, foie gras dish was probably the winner of the ""hot starts"", as all the components worked well with each other. We did have a ""cold start"" beets and goat cheese, started out good, but something was overly tart about the dish, and the beets weren't roasted enough, way too firm.

Had the Duck for the main course. Again, just ok. Had some strange cannoli cookie thing, doughy, and just out of place. So...

Thumbs up for the drinks!! Service, food, not so great. 

Food, all around was a miss. This restaurant is marketed/advertised as an innovative, trending hot new(ish) place to eat in Tampa. The shell might be there, but missing the inner workings.

The crust falls short, I wouldn't call this a thin crust, more like an average crust.  The problem though is that it is a tough crust, not that crispy yet chewy crust that you look for.  While you can fold this slice, the toughness doesn't allow the perfect fold.  It's more like a bend than a fold.  The flavor of the crust was very bland as well, and no char on the upskirt.  

Sauce was pretty good, had some spice to it.  I would like to see a bit more sauce on the pie.  The cheese was standard, not that wow cheese that pulls away from your mouth on bite.  Overall, not a bad choice if you are stuck at a hotel and are too lazy to go out.

But, I decided to give it a shot and figured I could always cut or dye it myself if things didn't work out. I definitely understand where some of the other comments on here come from, so I'd like to address those for anyone who is concerned like I was! Natalie D. posted a picture of her ""London haircut"" - my hair also initially looked like this, just to get the length right, but after coloring and washing it, he trimmed it up and everything is perfectly even. Natalie C mentioned that Cerrito only talks about himself, and I can see that; he initially told me all about his music, time at RISD, etc. I really think he just passionate about art/hair/music, and it didn't rub me the wrong way, but I guess he's an acquired taste. Overall I was really happy with my hair. He cut about 9 inches off, and I love it. The balayage really impressed me, however. I have used a lot of box color, to include dyeing my hair dark brown/black about 8 months ago. When he told me he doesn't use bleach (he uses Joico free play clay), I probably rolled my eyes a bit, and prepared myself for crappy results. I was shocked to see how light my hair is---it's actually blonde. He doesn't use toner, so it's on the yellowy side, but that is something I can do myself. I will definitely go back, and would recommend him to other people but you should be prepared to talk liberal politics, world events, and listen to his life story.

But once I walked in the door, the staff was so friendly and nice that even I started to believe I was hipster worthy. Maybe I am? I'm reevaluating. In fact,  I've really been thrown into an identity crisis ever since this experience. But everyone that I made eye contact with gave me a big warm smile so what can I say. I'd like to come back. 

I sat at the bar and enjoyed an eagle eye view of the door and the blend of patrons walking in to dine. It appears that this beloved hideaway is truly a Nashville favorite and is for everybody. Note: the bar is not elevated above the ground or anything...I'm just really tall. 

The brunch menu was amazing. I even tried my friends food when they weren't looking so I really got a flavor landscape of what the kitchen was capable of. I enjoyed the avocado toast that had blueberries, red onions, and feta on top. Unusual, but surprisingly delightful. My neighbor ordered the sour dough French toast that was so thick and delicious  it was wedding cake material. 

The breakfast tacos were slightly out of reach so they lived to see another day as far as my plate was concerned, but they looked mouth watering. Actually I think that my friend was on to me and decided to eat fairly fast as to not have to sacrifice a bite to my fork that was hovering at her side. 

The coffee was hot and served well and kept coming. We weren't rushed even though we should have been towards the end of the experience due to the amount of people who were walking in.

I went to pick up white bean soup.  It was really pretty good.

Yesterday, I went to pick up something for lunch and decided to try the smoked chicken salad sandwich.  When I order it, they said that they did not have any.  If it was around four in the afternoon, but this was around twelve twenty.  So I ordered the white bean soup again.  I waited over twenty minutes and thought if you have a pot of soup on the stove, it should not take that long. If it was busy that would be understandable, but there was a total of six people in the restaurant. Waited patiently and then I saw one of the chefs use a large spoon and scooped something out of a skillet and place in the styrofoam container.  That was my soup.  I am not a chef, but I know that you use a ladle for soup and soup is not cooked in a skillet.

When I got back to work I opened the container to find this clump of white beans...no liquid whatsoever.  I like white beans, but not a clump that looks like wallpaper taste.  The cornbread was reminiscent of Jiffy, but with white corn.

Maybe their best is the pulled pork, but sides are just as important.

There were probably on ten or so other folks dining in, so they were not that busy. The tacos which I was most excited about were just plain bad. The barbecoa taste like they cooked it next to shrimp or fish and it was extremely dry! The chicken... well it was just inedible. My wife said she felt like she was eating chicken from a can, my chicken tasted freezer burned. The pork had no taste like to expect from typical pork pastor. The quesadilla was almost all cheese, and again chicken in that was bad. I also had chicken fajitas, but I've already said enough about the chicken. Last but not least, the Quac!!!

Pros:
*Price -- Less than $220 all told for two weekend nights, which was pretty great for this area.
*Clean -- Everything was clean and seemed fresh.
*Friendly Staff -- Every interaction with staff was neutral to great!  Very courteous and personable.
*Hot Breakfast -- Good variety, including several protein options (which I loved) and pancakes (which my husband loved).
*Large Shower -- Would easily fit two average-sized adults or could easily fit a shower chair for those who need to sit. (Only one ""handicap"" bar on the wall, though.)
*Location -- It was very convenient to major roads without feeling overly exposed.  There were also a few places to eat within walking distance, which was nice.  It felt safe.
*Linens -- Mostly seemed thick enough and comfy.

Cons:
*Hot Breakfast Shortfalls -- It would have been nice if the sausage were what I call real sausage.  The patties they had were overly processed so had a funny texture.  The ""eggs"" were those round egg patties -- not bad, but not what I had hoped for from reading other reviews.  Also, at the beginning of breakfast, the sausage gravy was lukewarm at best.  (They did have a microwave close by, so it wasn't a huge deal.)  My husband said the biscuits were very dry.
*Linens -- They were clean and comfy but had very little weight to them.  I like a bit of weight on me when I sleep, so I was disappointed that there were no extra blankets in the rooms either so that I could just add another layer.
*Bed not level -- We were on a king-sized bed.  My side was slanted about 4.5 degrees with my head lower than my feet.  Since the bed was king-sized, there were actually two different pieces to the base.  My husband's side was slanted the opposite direction about 5.5 degrees.  I woke the first morning with my shoulders and neck hurting due to the slight but definite shift of my weight onto them.  My husband and I switched sides the second night and were both fine.  So this may or may not be enough to bother some people.  I didn't recognize the problem myself until more than half-way through the first night. (At first, I thought my discomfort may have had to do with my pillow, which it turned out was not the case.)

She has a very unique style with how she uses light in her photos and will take full advantage. After reading her website and learning her passion of telling people's ""stories"". Me and my husband immediately knew we wanted her as our photographer. She met with us to listen how we met, how long we've dated, our style, and the style of our wedding. When it came closer to the wedding she met with us again to do a timeline for the day of the wedding. (We ended up using that timeline for the bridal party, so everyone was on the same page.) She also asked and was very flexible in doing photos that you wanted or any particular photos of people that you wanted. I do not regret our decision with her as our photographer at ALL. Would highly recommend using Nicola.

We arrived at Dunkin around 11 am on a Sunday morning, and waited in line for an hour. Since the place just opened, we were expecting a long wait. An elderly lady stood outside manning the door, so that an even number of people entered and exited.  She had an awesome spunky personality that made the long wait less painful. Once inside, we started thinking about what donuts to select and decided on these: chocolate French cruller, raspberry filled, pink frosted, oreo, and traditional chocolate bar. 

At the counter, an overly friendly and rather spastic tiny blond girl (who probably already drank 10 cups of coffee) asked for our order. I started reading off our selections, as she began typing them into the register. Apparently the young teen boy behind her was supposed to be packaging the donuts as she rang them up. Well...he couldn't even figure out how to get the paper bag open. She turned around and saw him struggling - provided an example of how to open the bag - and I had to repeat my entire order. He just stood there staring at the donuts before finally putting one in the bag. I slowly began repeating for the 3rd time, and she turned around again to point out the appropriate doughnuts to this poor bewildered boy. Adding to  the confusion, the girl said ""you've already got 5, why not just make it a dozen?"" I politely declined, as that was way too many for 2 people. She began arguing that we should just buy a dozen because then one was free. No thanks. That would've taken an additional half hour anyways! Next I ordered the Chicken Salad Croissant, but they were out of croissants & I had to cancel. Also, I got a Mocha Chill, which was delicious, not overly sweet, and very refreshing. 

They almost had an over abundance of employees behind the counter - so many people running around that didn't have a clue what they were doing. It was a pretty chaotic situation, but I guess the flaws will be ironed out as training continues. The pink frosted donut was insanely sweet and had a funky fake strawberry taste, so we won't order that again. My favorite was the chocolate cruller, which had perfectly moist dough and fantastic frosting. I love that Dunkin doesn't fry the donuts, but bakes them instead.

The soup made up for the cocky salad with delusions of grandiose. It was nicely roasted peppery but sweet, dense and well mixed in with smokiness of gouda. We had a pretty decent service with the bartenders. There were only two of them and it was getting quite busy. I ordered one more drink, the salted caramel old fashioned. And even though it was nice and sweet, I should have probably not ordered it because it was quite potent and I think possibly made with Whiskey rather than a Bourbon, which made a difference in the morning after for me. 
Overall, pretty decent and glad they accepted my CL Deal with no issues.

The only thing I wish it had was a bigger screen, were used to having a ginormous- almost IMAX- screen in Hawaii for regular screening on new movies but it's ok, the amazing seats make up for it.  We experienced great customer service when we mistook the screening of Pirates of Caribbean 5 and almost missed 30 minutes of the movie.  Since they moved the room around that day, there was confusion of where to go when we were already rushing to our seats after being 45 min late, the manager (I wish I got his name) made it right and giving us the 12pm showing at no fee.  It made the sucky day into a great day since Pirates of the Caribbean is one our favorite franchise.  I think it's worth upgrading to AMC membership for $15 a year because they don't charge you $3 every time you buy your tickets in advance.  We wish we knew that because we saw 10 movies since Nov and we made up the $15 annual fee already from the $3 fees we paid reserving our seats.  Will definitely do it next year, just depends how many movies we feel like watching.   It's a great movie theatre, a bit far of a drive from central Tampa therefore watching the movies before 12pm for the matinee price and reserving your seats for $3 is worth it for the type of seats you get.  It gets colder than usual theatre too but you can bring your own blanket and enjoy.

As soon as we walked in, we immediately felt less tense, because the interior is quite eye catching! It is open, well designed, with bright clean areas. White and blue colors fill the room, it's really refreshing to take in. 

We were very quickly greeted and seated by our server for the evening, his name is Jeffrey, who is an absolute gem. My fiancé said that if we were ever to own a restaurant one day, that he would be the caliber of staff we would hire.

He works so efficiently, meaning that he works smart, not just hard. He has mastered the skill of preemptively providing service, because he fulfills  requests before guests even have to ask for it. He doesn't overdo it, the perfect amount of checking in and being present, that one feels very well taken care of, but not hounded. He really is an impressive server. 

I had white wine to start off with, the house Pinot Grigio and later switched over to Tito's and soda. 

Our food experience: 

*saganaki (which Jeffrey presented beautifully, flambé style, table side).

*calamari which was perfectly seasoned, not 

*side Greek salad (I love cheese, and the chunk of feta which I took home with me was creamy and flavorful).

* Gyro trio was very tasty 

We ended up taking food home, which after eating today, I can confidently say is well worth the visit here! 

The women's bathrooms are very clean, with a baby changing station and good lighting if you need to touch up your hair/makeup. 

They have a hookah station on the premises, which I'm sure adds to the overall dining experience, because it's a pretty interactive thing for guests to park take in.

I've never even remotely considered going sky-diving, for real. There is a zero percent chance I'll ever do it. And it's not because I think I would die... I actually fully trust the odds that everything would be a-okay, and that I even might really enjoy it after it's done. But I just cannot bring myself to get into a plane, go up in the air, and then jump into the atmosphere. Nope, never going to do it.

If you're a beginner, they tell you ahead of time that this will be somewhere north of an hour and a half long, and that you'll only be experiencing two minutes of actual pseudo sky diving action. I was kind of annoyed by that beforehand, but after actually experiencing it, I feel a lot differently.

Once you're inside the tunnel, time drastically slows down. On both of my runs, I felt like so much time had gone by, but I'd only used 20 seconds of my minute. You are concentrating so hard on following all of the instructions and keeping yourself balanced, all while kind of freaking out that you're floating on air. It's quite a different feeling.

You can opt-in for the high-fly, which I definitely recommend. About halfway through your second run, the instructor will take you about halfway up the tunnel several times. It's great because he/she does all the work and you just get to enjoy the ride. It's pretty surreal and makes the experience that much better.

Once you visit a few times, you can work on your skills and get better and better to the point where you can go back in without an instructor. It's definitely tempting, because at the end, our instructor went in and showed off his very impressive skills. Imagine someone literally being able to fly around like Superman, and that's what he did. 

The only problem is that you will definitely drop some serious money to get to that status, and as much as I enjoyed it, I don't know that I would want to be on the hook for that much cash. But I could definitely see getting into it if I had a few more bucks to spare.

Drinks:  Just as good as the north tampa location.  The boba is perfection, soft and sweet and goes great with any drink.  
I tend to prefer the milk teas since I like the creaminess and it lets you reduce the sugar content to 30% and I honestly can't tell the difference compared to 100% (for the taro milk tea), if reducing sugar id important to you without sacrificing taste. 
If you get any of the fruit drinks, make sure to get 100% sugar if you want it sweet, anything less you will notice a huge difference and may not like it as much. 
 
For the first few weeks after they opened, which is over 2 or 3 months now, it was obvious they were still working some things out, the boba was still kinda hard, not cooked long enough, the fruit drinks were not as sweet as they should have been at 100%, but now they worked out the kinks and serve amazing and consistent drinks.

First, the location. It is close to my house, but more importantly, it is easy to find on Hillsborough Ave, on the way to Oldsmar. As you walk in from the ample parking, the strip-mall feel completely disappears and this serene, tastefully decorated space gets you ready for your treatment.

You get a reminder one or two days prior to your appointment and from the moment you walk in the door you are greeted and catered to. Timeliness is one of my pet peeves and so far, all of mi appointments have started on time. 

Third, the price. This is a $40 one-hour Swedish massage. Every time. No coupon required. If you sign up for their various offers, you pay even less. You can't beat that. I started getting regular massages in my early 30s when I lived in the DC area and trust me when I tell you, in DC you couldn't get a 15-minute shoulder rub at the mall for $40. Well...

We've (my husband and I) tried many others and even at the ""voted best Cubans"" restaurants, we weren't wowed until this place. The first time we visited, we thought we could each handle a 12"" Cuban. (Subway length, so couldn't be too much, right?) Well, it was too much. They automatically come with a drink and chips, so we managed the first half of the sandwich with the sides, but saved the rest for dinner! They make it just right - all the way with pickles and mustard and crusty bread and three meats. It was pressed into a dense sandwich that is filling and yummy.

So, the first visit was in July of 2013. When we moved here this month, we had to find the same place. It took a minute to remember where this was, but once we saw pics of the place, we knew this was it. Once again, it was great food. This time we shared a 12"" and a Devil Crab. Although the Devil Crab was good, it wasn't for us. It was hot and moist, but not the flavors I care for. However, they are very popular, so it must be good.

Ok. So they were shy of a 5 star review for one reason - disorganization. They're too small for the volume of customers and there is no rhyme or reason to where you are supposed to order, wait for, or pick up your meal (at least during peak lunch time). But, the staff is friendly and the owner (I think) asked my name when I was near the counter and knew who I was when my food came up - about 10-15 minutes later.

She was in such a hurry we were unable to order much beyond alcohol. She was gone before I could even say ""and a water."" The one appetizer we were able to order was great.  It's a small place with at least 3 other servers so there was no discernible reason for the drive-by service. After multiple attempts to order food we gave up and just asked for a cookie to-go with the bill. We realized we had no silverware at our B&B so we asked a different waitress if they had plastic utensils to take with us. She said she'd check and then walked past us about five times over the next several minutes as we stood awkwardly by the bar holding our cookie topped with rapidly melting ice cream. When we finally stopped her to see about the answer she said, ""oh, I thought you asked someone else,"" which was really strange considering she had looked me in the eye and gave what seemed to be an appropriate response to my original question. I feel bad for this place because the food and drinks are really good and the cooks and bartenders seem friendly and normal.

We were there and so was a dog convention. So many dogs and all of them barked non stop when their owners left their rooms. 

Our neighbor was a real treat. And the sick thing is they had a baby in their room. LOUD sex and banging on the walls to the point it was making the headboards shake. 3am I finally went down to the desk and begged the guy to do something. Of course nothing he could do but offered to move my room. 3 am and we had a baby with us as well no thank you.

Of course we were very pissed off so we did want to speak with a manager. None was available at night nor the next day because they had the day off..... How do you not have a manager on duty?

ZqHy2Up0S8JEzgqoPHsYzQ,knyL5Q53vbgGmEBQLPLxVQ,a8q8Kd7KubA-qHpPAAH81g,"Sauce's first problem is surprisingly a lack of sauce.  From a place named Sauce, with smears of blood like sauce strewn around the windows and walls, a lack of sauce would be the one problem I never expected to encounter.  However, that's the one consistent problem I have with all three of their locations. 

My most recent encounter was at the Broadway and Rosemont store.  Now I'm a fan of the Fox Concept restaurants, but Sauce never fails to disappoint me.  I love pizza.  I could eat pizza everyday, but this place really misses the mark.  Their pizza is dry, and their pasta is flavorless (and usually lacking in sauce).  I will say that their salads are quite good.  For the food's sake, I'll start with the best dishes from my last visit, and work down to the worst. 

A surprising win in my opinion was their Turkey & Feta salad.  This salad is a delicious combination of turkey, almonds, avocado, feta cheese, cucumber, and tomato bathed in a lightly sweet dressing.  I would have been happy to have made a meal out of this, but sadly our food came shortly after.

The second best dish of the evenings was the lasagna.  I am actually not a fan of lasagna, but this isn't your traditional lasagna.  I'm not sure what they do differently, but it actually had some flavor.  It was a bit dry however, and could have used a bit more sauce.  

Next up was the chicken, broccoli, and cheese pasta... which is actually macaroni and cheese with chicken in it.  It's not even good macaroni and cheese, because it really seems to be lacking in either cheese flavor or sauce.  (They actually have something called ""Mac 'N Cheese"" on the menu, which I suspect is the same dish, before they add chicken and broccoli.)  

The next disappointment was their white bean potato.  Despite the name, this soup had neither beans nor potatoes in it.  I thought it would be a hearty soup filled with ingredients, but what I received was a watery bean flavored bowl of garbage.  

The final loser on the list was the pepperoni pizza with crimini mushrooms.  I've had this before at the Sauce on Campbell, but this one was absolutely terrible.  The pizza was mushy in the middle, and inedible along the edges.  What I mean by that is, the middle of the pizza was so wet with greases from the cheese and pepperonis, that none of the toppings would stay on the slice.  And the outer crust was a tooth breaking chunk of rock, which no mere mortal could possibly eat.  For some reason, there was no detectable amount of sauce on this pizza.  I'm not sure if they were trying to replace the sauce with grease, but it sure seemed like it.

As for the service... well, there really isn't any.  The cashier was friendly enough, but once they get your money they really seem to stop caring.  You see, Sauce's concept runs on a pay first and get your food later idea.  (You are even supposed to tip before any of the service has started!)  They bring you the food, and then that's it.  They don't even offer to refill your drinks.  (Even Sonic's car-hops will offer refills and check to see if you need anything else.)  

In short, don't go here for their pizza or pasta, but if you want an amazing salad, give Sauce a try.",2011-03-30,22:28:14,"Pizza, Restaurants, Bars, Nightlife, Italian, Salad, Wine Bars",Tucson,AZ,4,226,1.4500000000000002,2

Usually when you walk in you'll be put off by the line all the way to the door. Don't fret though, as the line goes quite fast and you can sample some bread while waiting. The kitchen service though can be hit or miss. It's usually only when you order a hot sandwich that it slows them down a lot. 

I ordered the Brads Beef which is roast beef, provolone cheese, green chiles, red onion, Russian dressing on white bread. It's so bad for you yet so good. Isn't that normally the case?

Important note to those who don't know. Avoid the Ciabatta bread at all cost. It comes standard on some sandwiches (though I don't know why). Those sandwiches have a tooth next to them on the menu. Why? Because you'll break a tooth on it, its so hard. There is nothing enjoyable about that bread. How many times do they have to be sued before it sinks in and they get rid of that awful bread or at least stop making it standard on sandwiches? (Tangent over)

If you have room afterwards try some of their awesome cookies. They also do the best banana bread and chocolate babka (Fridays only).",2015-01-09,00:41:56,"Sandwiches, Coffee & Tea, Food, Bakeries, Restaurants",Tucson,AZ,4,256,2.5,5

After moving to the west side my husband, brother, and I decided to make the 45 minute drive across town to come to our favorite pizza place. Unfortunately we had probably the worst service I have probably ever had at a bar or restaurant. First off, right when we walked in we felt unwelcome. While other people, which I'm assuming are regulars, got greeted warmly and immediately, we got the once over and were immediately asked if we were 21. We all ordered some pizza, appetizers, and a couple beers. The beer I got was not good and tasted syrupy, so after I took a sip I politely asked to have the beer replaced with something else. The server/bartender immediately said that since she poured it and I took a sip that I would still have to pay for this bad beer. My husband and I were like.... thats a strange policy to have. She became pretty argumentative, stating that every bar has that policy and if they gave everyone who didn't like their beer a new beer for free people would just do it all the time. What?! So I'm gonna take one sip of a beer, ask for a new free one, and repeat this one sip process over and over? Right... So then she asked the manager if I could have a new beer for no cost, came back with my new beer and said, ""Just so you know, I was able to take that beer off your check, just this one time."" and she continued to go on and argue with my husband about how they just lost $7 (which we all know a beer does not cost the restaurant $7 off the tap). I told my husband just to stop because we were obviously not getting anywhere with this conversation, and we ate our food feeling pretty uncomfortable for the remainder of the visit. When we were done, we paid and left without anyone saying any sort of goodbye. I have worked in the food industry my whole life and have never heard of any bar or restaurant that forces custimers to pay for drinks or food that they don't like, and also try to make them feel bad about it.

Needless to say, we will not be returning again and will also not be referring our friends anymore. We spent about $70 at this establishment and they lost our business and our referrals over a $1.50 pour of beer. Sadly, looking at some of the more recent reviews it seems like this may be the new norm here. We will be finding other local businesses to support during this time.

My wife and I have been fed up with our kitchen situation... we couldn't find someone to remodel it the way we wanted. So we decided that if we can't have our kitchen, let's do the bathroom. So I looked in the phone booth and I saw the re-bath and o thought you know let's give it a shot. I've never had someone come into my home and tell me what I can and can't do.. this was no exception. My sales clerk consultant person was named Ramon. I know this because my uncles name is Ramon as well. He came to our house and already had a thought for my bathroom in mind and the wife didn't seem to happy about it. We were spit balling ideas back and forth and then came the monetary amount.... basically how much do you have to spend. Which our reply was ""we want this done, but we aren't in a huge hurry."" ""If the price is right we can move on it today."" But the problem was that Ramon couldn't give us any type of amount that this might be. It almost seemed like even though we were still getting estimates from re-bath and others we still haven't decided what route we wanted to take. Ramon took pictures, took measurements and got all of our info...... and NEVER RETURNED. We waited for him to call back. I live by a strict motto... if I see I'm gonna call you back, I will. I should not have to go out of my way to call you so you can call me. Well either way. no new bathroom. No phone call and it left a bad taste in my mouth to now I will most likely either do it my self or call my wife's father do do the job for me.

After I paid the girl just looked at me. I had to ask for my drink cup. Then when my sandwich was ready, they put it on the counter with no bag, napkins, chips. I asked if I could have a bag and the girl hands me one. I then had to ask for napkins and chips (was too go) and she pointed at a spot to grab chips.

To make matters worst there was no manager on duty so unless we wanted to look for another hotel after a 7 hour drive we were stuck.

We than headed to the hot tub and found that to be over chlorinated and too hot to enter. While we were down there checking out the pool there were intoxicated guys running around the pool area taking advantage of the hotels 2 free drink policy at happy hour, maybe they should have thought about having security on duty.

So we returned to our room to settle in for the night, although the bed was comfortable the noise of people running down the hallway and the pool area  made sleep difficult until after 11:00 PM.

I wanted to walk out right then, but I had already bought the voucher. Gina never attempted to clear up the misunderstanding. Needless to say I was not happy. Getting a pedicure while you are mad at the person giving it, is an unusual experience. Neither of us spoke for the next 15 minutes. I didn't want to ""upset"" her any further for fear that it may change the way I was treated. After a little massage from the chair I was sitting in, I started to calm down and was able to engage in conversation. To be fair, Gina was very gentle and upgraded me to a shellac pedicure for no extra charge because she was out of regular nail polish for a French pedi. She seems like a sweet lady and she is good at what she does, but if there is a misunderstanding with a client (especially a first time client like myself), you want to make sure that you are not at fault...... and if you are, you apologize. She did neither. In either case, she should not worry who's at fault, but gladly except your customers patronage without showing a hint of frustration.

My son, a profsnl chef at a hi-end Calif restaurant, and I were guests of my family that lives in Tucson. They were well-received by all staff, as closer to friends than customers. So, it was surprising that the food delivery had some annoying mixups and delays. Scallops seemed frozen rather than fresh and were not cooked right. They were covered with a vague and watery sauce. Pasta with it also had watery sauce. I had a salad that was large and tasty. Another person had pasta that really wasn't up to the standards of a genuine Italian restaurant. They need to do some serious work on their pasta. Wine list and prices were very sharp. Wait staff should improve their performance instead of schmoozing skills.",2011-12-02,01:24:40,"Italian, Restaurants, Venues & Event Spaces, American (New), Nightlife, Cocktail Bars, Bars, Pizza, Event Planning & Services",Tucson,AZ,4,862,2.4749999999999996,2
vkv_apiC_n-Wcg6MaLxqSA,UunTAINMW6Z03BL3n3R1_Q,vPSRs9RRGbv4Y4nNWyw5Vw,"This used to be one of my favorite places in Tucson for a healthy fresh meal, but I've noticed lately their quality has really declined.  My favorite for breakfast is the Cacao Warrior bowl, which when made right and when the fruit is ripe, is still very good.  But in this item, inconsistency seems to be a major problem.  Sometimes the bowl has been huge and other times extremely small and the proportions of ingredients blended into the bottom part always seems to be different.  One time this summer another customer got a bowl literally twice as big as mine at the same time as me.  I brought it up that my bowl was smaller than usual and instead of remaking it, they just added some more fruit on top.  A very nice gesture, but not the same as more acai blended in with coconut milk for the base.  I just let that slide.  Then the barkback app is never working either, except for the first time it was advertised as a frequent flyer benefit.  Today they told me to download the app on my phone and they would credit me for the visits I had missed.  When that didn't work (the app said they didn't have a loyalty card yet), the manager said he needed to talk to the upper management, but didn't offer anything in return.  

The icing on the cake was the Aztec steak bowl I ordered today.  It was a far cry from the original bowl I used to love, was not as advertised on the menu AND had a hair in it that was not mine!  YUCK! Instead of avocado was guacamole that was heavy on the cilantro, not a flavor that I like if it predominates.  Instead of cabbage was coleslaw - hello?! - not everyone enjoys mayonnaise on their fresh, healthy bowl.  Instead of bright quick pickled red onions as in the past, a ton of heavy wine (?not sure, but I'm not supposed to have alcohol) braised or poorly caramelized onions were substituted instead.  Finally, the beef did not taste like grass-fed as advertised and the quality was not as I remember it either.  All in all it just didn't go well together and felt very heavy.  Then after I found the hair, there was no turning back.  

I called Goodness and spoke with Marley about this, who was really, really nice and refunded my money for the Aztec bowl immediately, so I'm adding one extra star for that.  Also, one star for the cacao warrior bowl when its good.  But with a name like goodness, I expect that to be all the time.  Really too bad because I love to concept - fresh, health and they support other local businesses, which is why in the past I'd tolerate their somewhat pricey menu, but after this experience I really don't think I'll be back.  I wonder if the management or ownership has changed hands or if after the expansion to skyline, they just can't keep up with the quality and consistency the way they used to.",2016-12-05,22:23:38,"Juice Bars & Smoothies, Specialty Food, Food, Health Markets, Fast Food, Vegetarian, Restaurants, Salad",Tucson,AZ,4,326,2.3999999999999995,2
rO4TLcpTpr1nGGInmbHSJw,mJy-5ShuwwYRayxRtl6xxA,vr1I1RkSL-m6c-LCAd3O7A,"Ok, so the honest truth is that there's something about Hifalutin that makes me not want to like it.  I can't really figure it out.  Maybe it's the decor, it's just not my thing.  However, I find myself reasonably enjoying my meals every time we go.

On our most recent visit this weekend, we arrived pretty early, just about 5pm.  The place was dead.  By the time we left, there were a few tables, but it never really got very busy.  

Let's start with the decor and atmosphere.  It's very dark inside the restaurant.  This could be ok -- romantic even -- but in a cowboy-themed restaurant, it's a little bit weird.  The cowboy theme is also weird in and of itself in Hifalutin.  It just seems a little bit forced.  The wait staff has to wear cowboy hats?  Meh.  The theme is certainly not winning me over, but whatever.

The menu isn't very large, but I think there's probably something for everyone who in general is ok with southwest-inspired food.  Think peppers and enchilada sauce.  There are some regular items, like sweet potato fries and potato skins, but mainly everything else has some sort of southwestern twist to it.

I ordered the chicken tortellini pasta and my husband had the pot roast sandwich.  Before the meal even arrived, complimentary blue corn muffins were brought to the table.  I honestly think they're delicious.  They aren't overly sweet, but they're sweet.  They're always warm and fresh, which makes them super soft on the inside.  The outside remains crunchy.  The balance is great.  They come with some butter, but I don't personally think they need any.  

My chicken tortellini pasta was good, but not great.  It was a good sized portion of tortellini.  They were also on the larger side themselves.  They were cheese filled, but I didn't really taste much of that.  The chicken was shredded and kinda hard to see in the plate because it blended in with the cream sauce that was mixed into it all.  It tasted good and was tender, though.  The cream sauce was also good.  The dish was also topped with some of their red sauce, which was basically a thick enchilada sauce.  It was ok.  I think they should have mixed it with the cream sauce instead of putting it on top, though.  It was definitely better with the cream than on its own.  Overall, I would get this dish again.

My husband always orders the pot roast sandwich here.  He just really loves it.  I tasted some of it, and it is rather good.  The meat was very tender and very flavorful.  The bun it comes on had cheese baked into it, which was a nice addition.  It came with ""cowboy"" fries, which were seasoned steak fries.  Nothing special.

Our server was very attentive.  We weren't without a drink at all during the meal.  She was happy to bring us more corn muffins and whatever other extras we asked for.  She was also friendly and personable.

The prices here seem ok to me.  The portions are large and the food is of decent quality, so I don't mind paying a little bit more.  We will definitely return to Hifalutin.",2013-07-21,22:13:08,"Nightlife, Mexican, Barbeque, American (New), Comfort Food, American (Traditional), Sports Bars, Southern, Bars, Restaurants, Steakhouses, Breakfast & Brunch",Tucson,AZ,4,239,3.3249999999999997,3

ZkvG45_-TOzQsTs3oFBNpg,yAZixpFz-eZKminzF2BXJw,x0eoomyyX1z7yeRcPglgSQ,"I use to love this place.  I've been a faithful customer for years and miss seeing ""Pancho"" the owner flinging hot wet towels to the customers with pinpoint accuracy from behind the sushi bar, well most of the time.  Now with Pancho moving on, the Oracle location is not nearly as good (in many ways) as it use to be.  Long waits for orders to be filled, wrong sushi presented because of careless chefs not reading the orders carefully, lack of  conversation skills of the chefs, excessive waits for beverages to be filled, etc.

Now that I slammed the Oracle location, there's still light at the end of the tunnel.  The north location on the Catalina Hwy is a great second.  When there ask for ""Noel"", sushi chef extraordinaire.  I really mean it.  He's funny, friendly and loves taking care of his customers.  I think he learned his customer service skills from Pancho who he still sees from time to time.  Noel will even come up with some ""custom"" sushi if you ask him nicely.  This guy really makes the place come alive.  My wife and I love Noel's quality sushi and his personality makes it perfect to boot.   One last word about Noel, if he serves you as well as he does us, I recommend you leave him a gracious tip as a token of your appreciation.

We live in Goodyear, AZ and every time we drive through Tucson, we make a mandatory stop at Sushi Hama north for our ""sushi fix"".   Sadly we stopped at the Oracle location a few days ago thinking it was closer to I-10 and hence quicker to get back on the freeway.  We were wrong in several areas.  First with all the downtown exits being closed by ADOT for road widening, one has to take the ""scenic route"" from either south Tucson or Marana to get there.  No time saved at all.  Secondly, the extra time it takes to get to the north location is more than worth it in the area of quality and ambiance.  We won't make this mistake ever again.

The ""all you can eat price"" has gone up from $19.99 to $22.99, but its still a good deal for those who love sushi.",2009-01-04,19:51:50,"Sushi Bars, Restaurants",Tucson,AZ,3,82,3.0250000000000004,5
