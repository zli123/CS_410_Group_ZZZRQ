The boy T.....was fired before he was able to quit.It's not right for white women to use our color to make false allegations against African-Americans  it's also not right  to use the judicial system to call people \"ghetto\" and claim the person threatened physical harm or file restraining orders against someone who spoke up for herself.My friend reached out to me for the video of the manager TABITHA yelling at the lady.

The chargrilled oysters were good, but they were on the small side, like baby oysters. Again, I prefer Neyow's or Drago's version. What really shined were the entrees. The fried fish was very tender, delicately fried and well-seasoned. The shrimp, fried and grilled, were on point. The hush puppies were fluffy, plentiful and tasty. I don't know how my daughter's fries tasted, but my son enjoyed his sweet potato fries. \n\nService: Our server Jade was very friendly, but not as attentive as we would've liked. For example, a table that were sat after us received their chargrilled oysters earlier than we did. In fact, our oysters came after our entrees. When I asked what happened, she blamed it on the guys in the kitchen saying they were backed up. We would've preferred the honest answer that she just forgot about our order. Besides that snafu, however, she was very sweet. \n\nAmbiance: What can I say, it's Acme. Don't wear your Sunday best. It's straight up casual, almost bar, hole-in-the-wall casual.

He''s gone there everyday for lunch for the last year and that's always intrigued me.  It must be good if someone eats it everyday right?  Well, yes and no...\n\nChipotle is not unlike any of the other burrito counter service joints.  You walk up to the counter, tell them what type of dish you'd like (tacos, burrito, salad, bowl, etc) and then you proceed down the line to tell them the ingredients.  It's a pretty successful business model and one that's used in at least 3 other burrito places that I know of.\n\nIn other words, Chipotle is not special and really isn't doing anything any better than others with the same model.  The food is decent and the service is exactly what you'd expect form a fast food joint like this.  Where they fail is on price and meal deals.\n\nSome of the other similar burrito places offer a free salsa bar and chips are included with your meal.  This is a standard at most Mexican restaurants.  For some reason, Chipotle thinks they are special and charges extra for chips and even more for salsa.  Yet, the price for just your main entree item is the same as what other places charge for the entree, chips, and salsa.\n\nLike I said, the food is decent, but the prices stink.  For that reason, I choose to take my business elsewhere.  The dining area is nice with contemporary styling and it was very clean, so that's a plus.

The system is bonkers, they make you wait for an employee to come out who you then have to flag down so they can take your name and then eventually start your order. The first time they were only accepting online orders because they were short staffed and COVID precautions, both of which are understandable, however it seems so strange to not just start the orders as they come in. The second time I came they were allowing people in and they served them immediately, pushing aside all online orders, even if you had put in a name. They also won't let you pick it up in store, despite the directions on the chipotle app. You instead have to wait for whenever an employee collects enough orders to bring them out, so they sit and get cold before it even gets to you. When you're letting people in to order, why can't people come in to pick up their food, you have the shelf for it already? Again, the food is fine but given how many people order takeout they should improve the pickup system.

Even decided to join in when they played the Chicken Dance! \nIf you've never experienced authentic german food than this may be a surprise for you. I definitely think it is an acquired taste.  The prices were a little high, but where else are you going to go for Jaegerschnitzel? Things worth trying: Jaegerschnitzel. Its breaded and fried veal and it was delicious here! Also there potato pancakes are spot on!  I had the Saurbrauten which is like thinly sliced (beef I think?) and topped with a sour gravy.  The gravy was a little sour than I like it, but I think it was cooked true to the style, just not so much my style.  And I am usually a huge fan of red cabbage, but this one was a little too sour for me as well.  Spaetzle was great!!\nLooking for a beer to rinse it all down with? Franzikhaner is my favorite! A wonderful unfiltered wheat beer! The services was ok.  Although friendly, he seemed very forgetful as we had to remind him on numerous occasions after requesting another drink or more water, etc.\nThey have a great deli and bakery next door that is definitely worth checking out but you may want to go before your meal as they do close earlier than the restaurant.

Corporate needs to CLEAN house. \nThe inside of the building was closed, so we proceeded through the drive-thru. There were about 6 cars ahead of us. We didn't move for 20 minutes. AT MC DONALDS. IN TUCSON. LIKE WHAT?\n\n As soon as we got to the kiosk, there were two lines to choose from. Line 1 and Line 2, we went to line two, furthest from the building and waited for the person on the headset to take our order. We hear a girl say, with a deep sigh, \"Welcome to McDonalds, so umm just to let you guys know we only are accepting cash\" ... Weird flex, but ok. Seems like this location only takes cash? Which to me is a little weird... But thank goodness we had cash on us! After we told her that'd be fine, she came back over the intercom abruptly saying,  \"it's going to be about a 20 - 30 minute wait\", then clicked. There was no where for us to say \"OK\" or \"Thank you not to worry\". There was no where for us to go even if we didn't want to wait. You can't just bail when you're stuck in the line with cars in front and behind you... \n\nWe waited about 3 minutes for her to come back to us to get our order in, we looked over to the other line, line 1, and a man's voice comes over the speaker to the next car, \"Hi Welcome to McDonalds... only accepting cash..\" \"okay cool\" \"What can I get started for you?\" Hearing this THEN, seeing two cars go ahead of me through line 1, AFTER WAITING 15 MINUTES, I said \"Excuse me, m'am?? M'AM?? Can anyone hear me back there?\" She came back on the intercom all frantic \"I SAID IT'S GOING TO BE 20 MINUTES\" \n\nHaving a child yell at a patron, I asked for her to get her manager to please explain why people that were behind me are now ahead of me.\n\nThe employee (female) told me that she doesn't have to get her manager and she is refusing me service.\n\nThat's fine sweetie. I didn't even want McDonald's but everyone else in the car did. \n\nThe reason this place was so backed up was because she hadn't put the orders in and waited and waited. It's her own fault she was so frantic and behind in the first place. I have worked in the food industry to get a good grasp on how the ship is running. The way these employees and management handle situations are piss poor. \n\nSadly, this isn't the first time it's happened to me at this location. The franchise owner is a disgrace to the golden arch. My friends have been yelled at here for the SAME EXACT SITUATION that happened to me. My friends have been yelled at because they went back up to the POS system and told them all the food was cold. The employee told them to eat their food faster, that it wasn't their fault.  Not to mention the food actually sucks. Sadly, when it's the only one that's open on your way home and you have cranky people in the car, you just got to give. \n\nThis location is an embarrassment to the company.

I was warned during my first appointment that not all the physicians were comfortable with VBACs. I decided to see what the next doctor said. At my next appointment I had a friendly physician who was very positive but did tell me that there are physicians who wouldn't feel comfortable with a VBAC. I asked how that would be handled at delivery and she explained that a shared delivery model  had been developed to decrease the rate of C-section at Abington Memorial and that a physician that is comfortable would be available. A shared delivery model means that all the OB physicians that cover the hospital take call and you won't necessarily even deliver with a physician from the practice, just so you are aware.  At my final appointment with the practice I was asked by a different physician when I wanted to schedule my C-section. I expressed a desire to attempt a TOLAC/VBAC and an induction if natural labor did not occur. I was told, \"If your cervix isn't favorable there is nothing we can do and we wouldn't attempt it.\" Further more, \"this baby needs to come out and you need to have a back up plan.\" The physician completely dismissed my questions and concerns. She put in orders for me to schedule a C-section. Additionally, I was handed a consent for the VBAC, if natural labor did occur. And was told, \"This is just some paperwork you need to fill out and bring back to your next appointment.\" A CONSENT. If you are not aware of the issue with that. An informed consent enables you to decide which treatments you do or do not want to receive. Also, informed consent allows you to make decisions with your healthcare provider. This collaborative decision-making process is an ethical and LEGAL obligation of healthcare providers. At 36 weeks I transferred my care to a practice that not only supports my desire for a TOLAC/VBAC but spent extensive time discussing my options if my cervix was not \"favorable.\" I can assure you ladies you have options. Advocate for yourself and do not accept less then what you feel comfortable with. This is your birth experience don't let ignorant physicians hijack it.

He was incredibly kind to us, and very passionate about ensuring each bite was cooked to perfection. The wine pairings were PERFECT and we actually went to the store today to pick up a few bottles! \n\nFirst course: burrata and roasted beets, with oranges and marcona almonds, with a balsamic and olive oil drizzle. Not a huge beet person but wow, they were delicious with the burrata. They were warm but not too soft, not too hard. \n\nSecond course: Scallops with corn and roasted tomato orzo.  The sweetness of the corn and tanginess of the roasted tomato in the orzo were the perfect compliment to the scallops which were cooked to perfection! The taste and texture of the scallops were amazing.  \n\nThird course: braised rabbit ragout. Ok so my husband and I originally asked to have this substituted...however once we got there and talked to Chef, we felt like we should try it. The dish was phenomenal! The sauce was to die for.\n\nFourth course: grilled hangar steak with truffle mushrooms, roasted potatoes and red wine demi glaze. This was the best hangar steak I've ever had. The sauce was mouthwatering. The wine pairing was on point - we went to the store the next day and got the chefs reco. \n\nDessert: balsamic strawberries, vanilla ice cream, warm delicious beignets - I was so full that I didn't want dessert but it was a perfect size and tasty!\n\nCheck out the photos attached to this review - if you think it looks amazing, you should make a reservation because the pictures do not do it justice!!

The dishes were plated beautifully!  The portions are not huge, but perfect for a three course meal.  You won't be overstuffed afterwards, but you also shouldn't be hungry.  I ordered the Milk and Cereal, the Hanger Steak, and the Panna Cotta.  The milk and cereal was really cool, like a soup, and came out in a cute little cereal box glass that the waitress pours into the bowl for you.  The hanger steak was absolutely delicious, cooked well and probably my favorite dish of the night.  The panna cotta was interesting, very fruity and had a strong black sesame flavor.

So technically, it's a 3-star Korean Restaurant.\n\nAlthough my preference is for real charcoal, dirty floors, and tin top tables with a bunch of ajumma's forcing food down your throat, for what it is, Miga is a good alternative to \"authentic\" Korean food.\n\nApparently open only for the past few months, it's BYOB until next week (according to our waiter).  We ordered two orders of galbi at $22 bucks an order  (horrifyingly close to NYC prices, but reasonable for the quantity provided), kimchi chigae (non-Korean dinner companion's request), and was provided a hae-mul (seafood) pajun (service!  woot woot!).  The galbi was cooked on an infrared electric stove top (with a charcoal log for flavor in the base - so we were told).  To be fair, it was surprisingly effective in grilling the meat - as I feared it might boil/steam as tends to be the case on electric stove tops.  A secondary plus with the electric grill was that it created far less smoke than a true charcoal or gas contraption.  This is obviously necessary at Miga, as they do not have the individual table vents.\n\nThe kimchi chigae had no teeth, but flavor-wise was passable.  It whiffed of that \"we're serving non-Koreans who might die from the spice\" flavor, but then again, it's kimchi chigae, hard to f*&^ that up.\n\nThe pajun was also passable - doesn't evoke thoughts of grandma's pancakes with a tin kettle of makoli, but then again, you're in the heart of Center City.\n\nBanchan was intriguingly varied and plentiful; always a key component of a good authentic Korean joint.  They even offered Ggae-jjang (spicy raw crab); but the offering was petite, to be kind.\n\nAs already indicated, it's a 3-Star Korean restaurant in Center City.

Is it authentic Mexican food, no. But that's fine. Sometimes I just want cheap, fast food, and this place usually hits the spot. \n\nThe staff here are always very nice. They genuinely seem to like taking my orders, allowing me to customize things (I hate sour cream and always ask them to take it off anything I order), and there always seems to be someone cleaning in the lobby area when we come in. These are all great things. \n\nThat being said, the drive-thru often gives you the wrong order, partial orders, or they end up putting what seems like extra sour cream on things. When my fiance and I go, we always check the order as we're pulling out of the drive thru because we've failed to in the past and end up getting home missing half an order. Or we have some other person's order, which means they have my delicious Cantina bowl. \n\nSome of the policies are confusing here. They stop making certain things at certain times. No, I'm not talking about breakfast. I mean at 10pm they tell me they cannot make the Cantina bowl. No idea why this is a policy. But on two separate trips I was told at two separate times (one at 10pm, one at 7pm) that they cannot make a Cantina bowl at that time. Ok... confusing. Not sure why. So be prepared for that hassle with certain things. \n\nOverall, it is a Taco Bell.

The problems began after I paid for my order. I was told to drive around and that I would be brought my order. Okay. I only ordered 3 items. But I remember that when I worked at taco bell, this was done by some managers to keep our stats up. Okay, I can live with that. I drive around and join what soon becomes a drive-in theater's worth of cars.\n\nI was the second of these cars, but the last to receive a bag. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Renija, the same woman who took my order, came out and asked us if our order was 4 Fiesta potatoes. It was not. I told her very clearly, that it was not. And she understood, I thought.\n\nThe bag I received was not what I ordered. The receipt inside was for, you guessed it, 4 fiesta potatoes. But the food inside was something completely different from either what I ordered or was shown on the receipt. So they had mixed up EVERYBODY'S order.\n\nWhen I approached the door, I found it locked, even though the dining room is scheduled open. Soon, the same woman who had handed me my bag came to the door. I informed her that the bag that she had given me was not my order. She just looked disappointed for a moment. Then she asked me to come into her closed lobby.\n\nAnd I stood in front of that counter for more than 10 minutes while this same woman went back to the drive-through. Another woman continued to mop the lobby behind me as I watched customer after customer come through the drive through, having their orders completed in normal time.\n\nFinally, after another guy arrived at work and came to her window, only then did she remember my existence. She asks me what I ordered and I tell her. \n\nI swear to Zeus, she did every single itrm wrong. But she did throw a complementary cinnamon twists into my bag, so yay. (I hate cinnamon twists. It's like eating stale air.)\n\nI asked for my receipt, because though I haven't done the review in years, I absolutely wanted to \"tell the bell\" about this experience. I am informed that she requires her manager to print me a receipt.\n\nEnter, manager. A young, morbidly obese black woman walking to the drive through register, asking me if I remember how much my order was. Bear in mind, I had been charged for this order around 25 minutes ago. I did not. After about 5 minutes, she gave me the receipt and replaced my complementary stale air with an all ice Baja blast.

Even if you go to get in line for when they open at 7:30am, there most likely will be someone there before you. Also, these are not 20 minute changes. They do take longer than oil places that just specifically change oil. They do have a nice waiting room with a coffee machine, a tv and wifi along with hightop tables for you to be able to work if need be. I have taken my computer with me several times. \n\nDuring one oil change the tech did not put my plug back in after doing the oil change so my oil just flowed right back out. While getting on US 19 all of a sudden my car totally froze up and turned off. Talk about scary because there was a ton of traffic all trying to get on 19 and it wasn't a good spot to break down (where is really). So I had to call a tow truck for my car to be taken all the way to Jim Browne in Tampa because my car has a warranty on it and they have to do the oil changes and work on it. Plus I was close to a Jiffy Lube and they were nice enough to come out and look at my car and confirm it was the oil plug. So tow truck costs all the way to Hillsboro from Pinellas and then a rental car because it was going to take them several days to fix all the damage their incompetence caused. I did talk to a manager about the situation and being refunded the costs and was told that they would submit everything to corporate for the refund. Well... during that process that person was fired and the new person new nothing of it. Thankfully, I always follow up via email and had the conversations to forward. After more back and forth I finally was able to get my refund in full. What a pain. \n\nMost of the time everything runs smoothly but at a slower pace than what I feel an oil change should take.

I opted to do a gel manicure and I think they left my hands under the UV light for far too long.  I began to feel a burning sensation in my fingers.

I asked the lady if I was supposed to take them out or let them go another cycle and she said they could stay in.  I don't get gel nails very often but I thought you're only supposed to need 1 cycle (maybe 2 at the most).  Mine went 3 cycles for each hand and that's when the burning started.  Even they were a bit concerned.  \n\nIn the end, my nails were fine and the polish lasted the 2 weeks that it's supposed to, but the burning sensation was cause for concern.  Also, when I went back 2 weeks later to have the gel soaked off, I was charged $10.  I've had other salons do this service for $3 and one salon I know of even does it for free, so I was a bit shocked by the $10.

She disagreed, even though we pointed to the menu item when ordering.  She didnt seem to care, later came back with what i assume was bavairan cream stuff, flung it on the table. The waffle was by now ice cold. And we got chaged and extra 2.00 on top of the 6.95 for 1 \"fancy waffle\".

Atchafalaya has a menu with enough creole food for people looking for a local experience, but also many other options for people who aren't.  Atchafalaya has two distinct personalities: Dinner here is a quietly impressive, elegant affair while brunch on the weekend is loud and boisterous with great music and an incomparable bloody mary bar.  Night time dining here is great for conversation where you really notice the eclectic art collection and the huge carved wooden tree on the wall.  During brunch, the music reverberates off the walls so it can be quite difficult to talk over the noise, but it's still a lot of fun.  This is a great place to take people who are visiting from out of town.  Whether I've taken people for dinner or brunch, all my visitors have been impressed and usually say it was their favourite dining experience while in NOLA.  \n\nI have had shrimp and grits more times than I can count in the South and I still think that Atchafalaya's are by far the best I've ever had.  Coquette's are good too, but don't have the depth of flavour of Atchafalaya's.  Their fried green tomatoes benefit from the addition of crab meat; this is a much more refined version than what you'll get at other places around town.  The Atchafalaya house salad was better than described, I was surprised at how good it was.  I wasn't impressed with the side order of vegetable risotto, it was a bit of a tasteless mush, not on par with the rest of the meal at all.  All of their fish dishes are excellent, I really can't think of another restaurant that has so many tasty fish options.  Although I personally don't eat red meat, my dining companions have all stated that their NY strip steak and the filet special are some of the best they've ever eaten.\n\nThis is one of the few places I've been to in NOLA where the food and the atmosphere are equally on par.  There are many beautiful old school places to eat in the French Quarter, but none of them have the exemplary food that Atchafalaya offers.  I can't recommend Atchafalaya highly enough.\n\nside note:  90 percent of the time the shrimp and grits excel, but occasionally they are inconsistent and taste a bit lackluster, I can only assume this is if the regular chef has a night off?"]], "date": "2014-08-08", "time": "16:46:25", "categories": "Seafood, Breakfast & Brunch, American (New), Bars, Southern, Restaurants, Cajun/Creole, Nightlife", "city": "New Orleans", "state": "LA", "stars": 4.5, "business_review_count": 2037, "predicted_review_score": 3.525, "actual_yelp_score": 5.0}, {"review_id": "PBElL5TvK4rIM6CJjmMxgQ", "user_id": "P18y0k5ICH0_vbqXZjgyiA", "business_id": "ChlcxTEoWBQJXJ2Xb2vm5g", "review": [["Unmemorable is the best way to describe our evening. \n\nService- Mediocre.

They either forgot 2 oysters or it's poor presentation. Should be served with a few pieces of french bread for sopping up the butter sauce. \n\nEntrees- Disappointing\n\nShrimp and Grits- 2 shrimp had full peels left on them. I usually expect to peel my own shrimp for BBQ shrimp...but not shrimp and grits and not at a fancy-ish establishment. \n\nGarlic Crusted Drum- It tasted like it was breaded in \"shake and bake.\" There was too much garlic topping and my cut of fish was so bad it almost looked like chicken. It was a very thick piece and I don't think it was cooked all the way through. It had a terrible blood line through it and was inedible. A waste of $31.

I have to hyphenate because no other country has this type of cuisine, not even China. As far as I know. After living in Japan for three years it was sourly missed. I will leave out atmosphere and d\u00e9cor evaluations because, let's face it, it's fast food. Although, the lady behind the cash register was hilarious. She cared about one thing, getting your order as quickly as possible. She was not rude just overly expedient than normal. It was if she had 10 seconds to complete every individual order. Anyway, on to the food.\n\nWe had our food there at the restaurant. The tables were clean-ish. It took about 10-15 minutes for our order to be prepared before we had to go back up to the speed queens throne to retrieve our food. I guess she didn't have time to bring it to our table but like I said, it's fast food. At first glance I noticed that the takeout containers, without the top lid, were stuffed with food. That's a big plus so since I usually start with five stars on my evaluations and mark down from there, I have to mark up from five to six stars (don't worry it'll make since in a minute). \n\nI ordered the General Tso's chicken combo (fried rice and 1x egg roll/1x crab rangoon (CR). They have it listed on the menu as something spelled slightly different but I knew it would be the same. I've had this many times before and sometimes they use very low quality chicken but not here. The sauce was the perfect blend of sweet and spicy for this dish. I have to deduct a star (5 star) because the chicken was not as crispy as I like but it was good. The pork fried rice was average but a little dry. My wife ordered the seafood combo with large chunks of \"crab meat\" but the artificial taste made them inedible. I have to deduct another star (4 star) for the \"crab meat.\"   \n\nThe best part of the dish was the CR. Although I always opt to get CR instead of an egg roll whenever possible I also ordered an entire order of CR (4 piece) as a side. I was pleasantly surprised with how large these CR were. The wontons were crispy, a little chewy and not overly greasy. Probably the best CR I've had in a long time. This calls for another star to be added (5 star). Oh, if you go, make sure to get \"red sauce\" with your CR. It's 85 cents extra but it's worth it. \n\nI will definitely return."]], "date": "2018-11-27", "time": "21:11:20", "categories": "Chinese, Restaurants", "city": "Saint Louis", "state": "MO", "stars": 3.5, "business_review_count": 64, "predicted_review_score": 3.3000000000000003, "actual_yelp_score": 5.0}, {"review_id": "6ZsOoqqZ3QLYxCZ2rclmQw", "user_id": "NmWq8MYyckcaiSJS9nG8wg", "business_id": "uNTT5JHQsL781H_v4A4LoA", "review": [["The new owners are not doing a good job.

It made taking the photos a lot more fun. He also stays ALL day. He doesn't put a time limit on the event. We loved that. Time limits can be stressful because you're trying to get all the photos done before they have to leave. All he asks is for a meal for him and his assistant. The last and biggest thing we loved was that he helped side step a problem. My dad forgot his tie, but before I could have a mini panic attack that we were out a tie, my mom came in and told me that the photographer offered his grey tie to my dad. His tie matched really well with the suits and it was perfect! It was very kind and caring of him to do that.

To be honest, the food was ok. It was like lunch and a show for the price, which this will focus on. \n\nWe were there around 1:45pm today, Sunday, and it was like opening day. People everywhere waiting for food, for seats to open up, everything.  Online order pickup, dine in pick up, the drink and cutlery station and the only trash can in the entire place was all within arms reach of the main counter which made for a lot of frustrated shuffling amongst customers and the staff. We ordered and found 2 bar stools facing the wall. While my wife kept a seat for me, I waited near the register for our order as employee April running the counter, who appeared to be the manager, was putting minimal effort into using her voice to call names for ready orders. The order screen has the option to put in your phone number to get a text when your order is ready, but we all know that's strictly for marketing purposes and I don't give out my number like that. Frankly, I find it unnecessary in a space that I could walk end to end in 10 seconds. Put in a PA system for when it's busy. \n\nWhile I waited for the food, about 25 minutes, I heard an employee come to who April and say \"we need arugula\", she was to go get it from the refrigerator and the employee said she didn't see any. No remedy attempt made that I heard while I continued to wait so I can only assume there were some unhappy folks who ordered a salad later. Also during this time, I saw 2 different patrons come to the counter to collect their order and pay cash and the same manager, seemingly very annoyed by the customers intent to pay, shrugged them off and told them that the computer system wasn't allowing them to take cash currently, almost in a \"tough sh*t\" tone, then sent them in there way with free food. That looked real good to the 15+ other customers standing around who had already paid with a card. When our order came up, I picked it up and there was only one fountain drink cup while we had ordered 2. I mentioned this to April and asked for a second cup. She told me \"there's only one on the order.\" As I was about to remind her I had just seen her send customers home with at least $60 in free food and I had clearly paid for 2 drinks, even though Honeygrow doesn't print you a receipt to combat the argument, she just slapped one down on the counter and walked away. \n\nPresentation is as important as taste and the taste at the KOP Honeygrow didn't make up for the poor presentation by the manager."]], "date": "2018-11-05", "time": "03:21:10", "categories": "American (New), Restaurants, Vegetarian, Salad, Noodles, Vegan", "city": "King Of Prussia", "state": "PA", "stars": 3.5, "business_review_count": 159, "predicted_review_score": 1.2249999999999999, "actual_yelp_score": 2.0}, {"review_id": "D8TpEL5R8CYl2z47LS9RtA", "user_id": "kYNAdzk9ofmaZYmTciYxCA", "business_id": "ExcFu7R8ATHczORJ4opEUA", "review": [["A step above your average diner in terms of variety of dishes.

I could hear her in the background. 2.

Well, we're visiting from out of town, disclaimer we're from the SF Bay Area. That doesn't mean that we expect more, it just means that we've experienced some really well made dishes, and just overall experiences. My wife and I were hopeful with Edison, with Chef Pierola, James Beard etc. Maybe she was out that night. At any rate, let's get started.  \n\nOverall, the aesthetics of the interior are very welcoming, warm, edgy, a bit on the dark side, but we enjoyed the scene. Very few people that night, so we thought we would get great service, not the case. The Host was cool, sat us quickly (reservation), and we looked over our menu(s). Matthew was our server. Really nice guy, and explained each menu well, and we started with a few drinks. For the record, the place had very few patrons, and we waited 10+ minutes for drinks. I've dined in South America, Spain, etc, so I'm ok with long waits, if that's the norm, but it's not the norm here, so we waited. \n\nDrinks were outstanding. I would come back for the drinks. We ordered our food, and our server asked how we'd like it to come out, and I requested it to be staggered, not many patrons, slow enjoyable evening. The dishes essentially came out on top of each other, not how I like to spend a night eating an anniversary dinner. Quality just wasn't there. Bone marrow, sub par, Charred Octopus (I love octopus) ashy and just lacking, foie gras dish was probably the winner of the \"hot starts\", as all the components worked well with each other. We did have a \"cold start\" beets and goat cheese, started out good, but something was overly tart about the dish, and the beets weren't roasted enough, way too firm.\n\nHad the Duck for the main course. Again, just ok. Had some strange cannoli cookie thing, doughy, and just out of place. So...\n\nThumbs up for the drinks!! Service, food, not so great. \n\nFood, all around was a miss. This restaurant is marketed/advertised as an innovative, trending hot new(ish) place to eat in Tampa. The shell might be there, but missing the inner workings. Again, not sure if the 5X James Beard Semifinalist was out, or is an infrequent guest Chef, but somethings is a miss here. \n\nBest of luck in the future."]], "date": "2019-11-27", "time": "18:14:40", "categories": "American (New), Restaurants, Wine Bars, Beer Bar, Bars, Nightlife", "city": "Tampa", "state": "FL", "stars": 4.0, "business_review_count": 848, "predicted_review_score": 2.75, "actual_yelp_score": 2.0}, {"review_id": "un5oaad-fDjdal7S6cr7cA", "user_id": "ivggqiPNEOqLDhX7_RlPYQ", "business_id": "MiPN-oUTmplbe9LTxDmkag", "review": [["Omgoodness!

I definitely understand where some of the other comments on here come from, so I'd like to address those for anyone who is concerned like I was! Natalie D. posted a picture of her \"London haircut\" - my hair also initially looked like this, just to get the length right, but after coloring and washing it, he trimmed it up and everything is perfectly even. Natalie C mentioned that Cerrito only talks about himself, and I can see that; he initially told me all about his music, time at RISD, etc. I really think he just passionate about art/hair/music, and it didn't rub me the wrong way, but I guess he's an acquired taste. Overall I was really happy with my hair. He cut about 9 inches off, and I love it. The balayage really impressed me, however. I have used a lot of box color, to include dyeing my hair dark brown/black about 8 months ago. When he told me he doesn't use bleach (he uses Joico free play clay), I probably rolled my eyes a bit, and prepared myself for crappy results. I was shocked to see how light my hair is---it's actually blonde. He doesn't use toner, so it's on the yellowy side, but that is something I can do myself.

Very courteous and personable.\n*Hot Breakfast -- Good variety, including several protein options (which I loved) and pancakes (which my husband loved).\n*Large Shower -- Would easily fit two average-sized adults or could easily fit a shower chair for those who need to sit. (Only one \"handicap\" bar on the wall, though.)\n*Location -- It was very convenient to major roads without feeling overly exposed.  There were also a few places to eat within walking distance, which was nice.  It felt safe.\n*Linens -- Mostly seemed thick enough and comfy.\n\nCons:\n*Hot Breakfast Shortfalls -- It would have been nice if the sausage were what I call real sausage.  The patties they had were overly processed so had a funny texture.  The \"eggs\" were those round egg patties -- not bad, but not what I had hoped for from reading other reviews.  Also, at the beginning of breakfast, the sausage gravy was lukewarm at best.  (They did have a microwave close by, so it wasn't a huge deal.)  My husband said the biscuits were very dry.\n*Linens -- They were clean and comfy but had very little weight to them.  I like a bit of weight on me when I sleep, so I was disappointed that there were no extra blankets in the rooms either so that I could just add another layer.\n*Bed not level -- We were on a king-sized bed.  My side was slanted about 4.5 degrees with my head lower than my feet.  Since the bed was king-sized, there were actually two different pieces to the base.  My husband's side was slanted the opposite direction about 5.5 degrees.  I woke the first morning with my shoulders and neck hurting due to the slight but definite shift of my weight onto them.

We arrived at Dunkin around 11 am on a Sunday morning, and waited in line for an hour. Since the place just opened, we were expecting a long wait. An elderly lady stood outside manning the door, so that an even number of people entered and exited.  She had an awesome spunky personality that made the long wait less painful. Once inside, we started thinking about what donuts to select and decided on these: chocolate French cruller, raspberry filled, pink frosted, oreo, and traditional chocolate bar. \n\nAt the counter, an overly friendly and rather spastic tiny blond girl (who probably already drank 10 cups of coffee) asked for our order. I started reading off our selections, as she began typing them into the register. Apparently the young teen boy behind her was supposed to be packaging the donuts as she rang them up. Well...he couldn't even figure out how to get the paper bag open. She turned around and saw him struggling - provided an example of how to open the bag - and I had to repeat my entire order. He just stood there staring at the donuts before finally putting one in the bag. I slowly began repeating for the 3rd time, and she turned around again to point out the appropriate doughnuts to this poor bewildered boy. Adding to  the confusion, the girl said \"you've already got 5, why not just make it a dozen?\" I politely declined, as that was way too many for 2 people. She began arguing that we should just buy a dozen because then one was free. No thanks. That would've taken an additional half hour anyways! Next I ordered the Chicken Salad Croissant, but they were out of croissants & I had to cancel. Also, I got a Mocha Chill, which was delicious, not overly sweet, and very refreshing. \n\nThey almost had an over abundance of employees behind the counter - so many people running around that didn't have a clue what they were doing. It was a pretty chaotic situation, but I guess the flaws will be ironed out as training continues. The pink frosted donut was insanely sweet and had a funky fake strawberry taste, so we won't order that again. My favorite was the chocolate cruller, which had perfectly moist dough and fantastic frosting. I love that Dunkin doesn't fry the donuts, but bakes them instead. Oh and one more strike for Donut Boy... when we got home, we found that he put the pink frosted donut upside down on the chocolate bar, so it had become a choco-pinky gooey mess.

The soup made up for the cocky salad with delusions of grandiose. It was nicely roasted peppery but sweet, dense and well mixed in with smokiness of gouda. We had a pretty decent service with the bartenders. There were only two of them and it was getting quite busy. I ordered one more drink, the salted caramel old fashioned.

We experienced great customer service when we mistook the screening of Pirates of Caribbean 5 and almost missed 30 minutes of the movie.  Since they moved the room around that day, there was confusion of where to go when we were already rushing to our seats after being 45 min late, the manager (I wish I got his name) made it right and giving us the 12pm showing at no fee.  It made the sucky day into a great day since Pirates of the Caribbean is one our favorite franchise.  I think it's worth upgrading to AMC membership for $15 a year because they don't charge you $3 every time you buy your tickets in advance.  We wish we knew that because we saw 10 movies since Nov and we made up the $15 annual fee already from the $3 fees we paid reserving our seats.  Will definitely do it next year, just depends how many movies we feel like watching.   It's a great movie theatre, a bit far of a drive from central Tampa therefore watching the movies before 12pm for the matinee price and reserving your seats for $3 is worth it for the type of seats you get.

It is open, well designed, with bright clean areas. White and blue colors fill the room, it's really refreshing to take in. \n\nWe were very quickly greeted and seated by our server for the evening, his name is Jeffrey, who is an absolute gem. My fianc\u00e9 said that if we were ever to own a restaurant one day, that he would be the caliber of staff we would hire.\n\nHe works so efficiently, meaning that he works smart, not just hard. He has mastered the skill of preemptively providing service, because he fulfills  requests before guests even have to ask for it. He doesn't overdo it, the perfect amount of checking in and being present, that one feels very well taken care of, but not hounded. He really is an impressive server. \n\nI had white wine to start off with, the house Pinot Grigio and later switched over to Tito's and soda. \n\nOur food experience: \n\n*saganaki (which Jeffrey presented beautifully, flamb\u00e9 style, table side).\n\n*calamari which was perfectly seasoned, not \n\n*side Greek salad (I love cheese, and the chunk of feta which I took home with me was creamy and flavorful).\n\n* Gyro trio was very tasty \n\nWe ended up taking food home, which after eating today, I can confidently say is well worth the visit here! \n\nThe women's bathrooms are very clean, with a baby changing station and good lighting if you need to touch up your hair/makeup. \n\nThey have a hookah station on the premises, which I'm sure adds to the overall dining experience, because it's a pretty interactive thing for guests to park take in. \n\nI can't wait to come back on a Friday or Saturday evening, dressed up and ready to sample more from their extensive menu.

There is a zero percent chance I'll ever do it. And it's not because I think I would die... I actually fully trust the odds that everything would be a-okay, and that I even might really enjoy it after it's done. But I just cannot bring myself to get into a plane, go up in the air, and then jump into the atmosphere. Nope, never going to do it.\n\nBut a controlled environment with gigantic fans powering you up in the air? Sounds like a fun Sunday!\n\nAs he does most of the time, unless it's letting his family bully him into going to chain restaurants, Chris W really came through here. I probably wouldn't have gone through the trouble of actually visiting iFly, but he found a Groupon that allowed us to score quite a nice discount, and I was sold. \n\nIf you're a beginner, they tell you ahead of time that this will be somewhere north of an hour and a half long, and that you'll only be experiencing two minutes of actual pseudo sky diving action. I was kind of annoyed by that beforehand, but after actually experiencing it, I feel a lot differently.\n\nOnce you're inside the tunnel, time drastically slows down. On both of my runs, I felt like so much time had gone by, but I'd only used 20 seconds of my minute. You are concentrating so hard on following all of the instructions and keeping yourself balanced, all while kind of freaking out that you're floating on air. It's quite a different feeling.\n\nYou can opt-in for the high-fly, which I definitely recommend. About halfway through your second run, the instructor will take you about halfway up the tunnel several times. It's great because he/she does all the work and you just get to enjoy the ride. It's pretty surreal and makes the experience that much better.\n\nOnce you visit a few times, you can work on your skills and get better and better to the point where you can go back in without an instructor. It's definitely tempting, because at the end, our instructor went in and showed off his very impressive skills. Imagine someone literally being able to fly around like Superman, and that's what he did. \n\nThe only problem is that you will definitely drop some serious money to get to that status, and as much as I enjoyed it, I don't know that I would want to be on the hook for that much cash.

Seriously, they make the best Cuban sandwiches in town. We've (my husband and I) tried many others and even at the \"voted best Cubans\" restaurants, we weren't wowed until this place. The first time we visited, we thought we could each handle a 12\" Cuban. (Subway length, so couldn't be too much, right?) Well, it was too much. They automatically come with a drink and chips, so we managed the first half of the sandwich with the sides, but saved the rest for dinner! They make it just right - all the way with pickles and mustard and crusty bread and three meats. It was pressed into a dense sandwich that is filling and yummy.\n\nSo, the first visit was in July of 2013. When we moved here this month, we had to find the same place. It took a minute to remember where this was, but once we saw pics of the place, we knew this was it. Once again, it was great food. This time we shared a 12\" and a Devil Crab. Although the Devil Crab was good, it wasn't for us. It was hot and moist, but not the flavors I care for. However, they are very popular, so it must be good.\n\nOk. So they were shy of a 5 star review for one reason - disorganization. They're too small for the volume of customers and there is no rhyme or reason to where you are supposed to order, wait for, or pick up your meal (at least during peak lunch time). But, the staff is friendly and the owner (I think) asked my name when I was near the counter and knew who I was when my food came up - about 10-15 minutes later.\n\nIt is worth the cost (great deals) and the wait.

The bread is fresh and soft, the stuffing tastes homemade, the turkey is tender and is NOT dry (as someone else said in another review), and the cranberry sauce really gives it a kick!  Only thing missing for a complete thanksgiving dinner is the mashed potatoes and gravy. My husband got the homemade meatball sub and said it was excellent. The sauce was like Grandma makes and the meatballs were better than any Italian restaurant around here. The portions are also large for the price. $4.99 gets you a 6\" sub stuffed with meats, cheese, and veggies. We both ate for under $13 with drinks.

The menu was cool and interesting. The cover contained a few disclaimers and disclosures regarding the content on the tv screens, walls, and social media and the food offerings. I was surprised to see a variety of options including several vegan dishes. I went with a Pineapple Express burger. It came with a side of salt and vinegar gaufrette chips. Both were very tasty. I was able to eat my entire meal. I believe my party of five all got different things from the menu and we were all satisfied our choices. I also tried the vegan Pickle Fries and Star Tots.

We were told only two gates in the stadium were open for fans to enter. There were fans everywhere, jam packed in a small area like sardines. There were thousands of people trying to get in.  It was a very high stress and dangerous situation.  The fans remained calm, for the most part, but in a situation like that you will be pushed and feel as if you were being piled on top of.  We missed DJ Khaled set completely. As we FINALLY got to the front of the line (an hour and a half later), ONE employee was making a woman empty her purse into a clear ziplock bag. This was the ONLY moment I saw any glimpse of bags being \"searched.\"  My friends said they saw one person with a metal detector wand, which they were not using in any manor. I did not see anyone using a metal detector, ever.  I felt bad for their employees being put in that situation.  The Vanderbilt stadium had complete lack of organization which put their fans at risk of a dangerous situation, and that is COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!!!

From a place named Sauce, with smears of blood like sauce strewn around the windows and walls, a lack of sauce would be the one problem I never expected to encounter.  However, that's the one consistent problem I have with all three of their locations. \n\nMy most recent encounter was at the Broadway and Rosemont store.  Now I'm a fan of the Fox Concept restaurants, but Sauce never fails to disappoint me.  I love pizza.  I could eat pizza everyday, but this place really misses the mark.  Their pizza is dry, and their pasta is flavorless (and usually lacking in sauce).  I will say that their salads are quite good.  For the food's sake, I'll start with the best dishes from my last visit, and work down to the worst. \n\nA surprising win in my opinion was their Turkey & Feta salad.  This salad is a delicious combination of turkey, almonds, avocado, feta cheese, cucumber, and tomato bathed in a lightly sweet dressing.  I would have been happy to have made a meal out of this, but sadly our food came shortly after.\n\nThe second best dish of the evenings was the lasagna.  I am actually not a fan of lasagna, but this isn't your traditional lasagna.  I'm not sure what they do differently, but it actually had some flavor.  It was a bit dry however, and could have used a bit more sauce.  \n\nNext up was the chicken, broccoli, and cheese pasta... which is actually macaroni and cheese with chicken in it.  It's not even good macaroni and cheese, because it really seems to be lacking in either cheese flavor or sauce.  (They actually have something called \"Mac 'N Cheese\" on the menu, which I suspect is the same dish, before they add chicken and broccoli.)  \n\nThe next disappointment was their white bean potato.  Despite the name, this soup had neither beans nor potatoes in it.  I thought it would be a hearty soup filled with ingredients, but what I received was a watery bean flavored bowl of garbage.  \n\nThe final loser on the list was the pepperoni pizza with crimini mushrooms.  I've had this before at the Sauce on Campbell, but this one was absolutely terrible.  The pizza was mushy in the middle, and inedible along the edges.  What I mean by that is, the middle of the pizza was so wet with greases from the cheese and pepperonis, that none of the toppings would stay on the slice.  And the outer crust was a tooth breaking chunk of rock, which no mere mortal could possibly eat.  For some reason, there was no detectable amount of sauce on this pizza.  I'm not sure if they were trying to replace the sauce with grease, but it sure seemed like it.\n\nAs for the service... well, there really isn't any.  The cashier was friendly enough, but once they get your money they really seem to stop caring.  You see, Sauce's concept runs on a pay first and get your food later idea.  (You are even supposed to tip before any of the service has started!)  They bring you the food, and then that's it.  They don't even offer to refill your drinks.  (Even Sonic's car-hops will offer refills and check to see if you need anything else.)  \n\nIn short, don't go here for their pizza or pasta, but if you want an amazing salad, give Sauce a try."]], "date": "2011-03-30", "time": "22:28:14", "categories": "Pizza, Restaurants, Bars, Nightlife, Italian, Salad, Wine Bars", "city": "Tucson", "state": "AZ", "stars": 4.0, "business_review_count": 226, "predicted_review_score": 1.4500000000000002, "actual_yelp_score": 2.0}, {"review_id": "RPRW79hrdPFAEMlEfCHMoA", "user_id": "SokgF7HoIlSq7hC_jo_fCg", "business_id": "6GeezpXz_jYeVnt450fOKg", "review": [["The atmosphere is very cool, and the food is unreal! \nThis place is going to do great things! \n\nYou can fill up on a burger but the fries are real delish so get them.\n\nAlso beer.

Don't fret though, as the line goes quite fast and you can sample some bread while waiting. The kitchen service though can be hit or miss. It's usually only when you order a hot sandwich that it slows them down a lot. \n\nI ordered the Brads Beef which is roast beef, provolone cheese, green chiles, red onion, Russian dressing on white bread.

It comes standard on some sandwiches (though I don't know why). Those sandwiches have a tooth next to them on the menu. Why? Because you'll break a tooth on it, its so hard. There is nothing enjoyable about that bread. How many times do they have to be sued before it sinks in and they get rid of that awful bread or at least stop making it standard on sandwiches?

After moving to the west side my husband, brother, and I decided to make the 45 minute drive across town to come to our favorite pizza place. Unfortunately we had probably the worst service I have probably ever had at a bar or restaurant. First off, right when we walked in we felt unwelcome. While other people, which I'm assuming are regulars, got greeted warmly and immediately, we got the once over and were immediately asked if we were 21. We all ordered some pizza, appetizers, and a couple beers. The beer I got was not good and tasted syrupy, so after I took a sip I politely asked to have the beer replaced with something else. The server/bartender immediately said that since she poured it and I took a sip that I would still have to pay for this bad beer. My husband and I were like.... thats a strange policy to have. She became pretty argumentative, stating that every bar has that policy and if they gave everyone who didn't like their beer a new beer for free people would just do it all the time. What?! So I'm gonna take one sip of a beer, ask for a new free one, and repeat this one sip process over and over? Right... So then she asked the manager if I could have a new beer for no cost, came back with my new beer and said, \"Just so you know, I was able to take that beer off your check, just this one time.\" and she continued to go on and argue with my husband about how they just lost $7 (which we all know a beer does not cost the restaurant $7 off the tap). I told my husband just to stop because we were obviously not getting anywhere with this conversation, and we ate our food feeling pretty uncomfortable for the remainder of the visit. When we were done, we paid and left without anyone saying any sort of goodbye. I have worked in the food industry my whole life and have never heard of any bar or restaurant that forces custimers to pay for drinks or food that they don't like, and also try to make them feel bad about it.\n\nNeedless to say, we will not be returning again and will also not be referring our friends anymore. We spent about $70 at this establishment and they lost our business and our referrals over a $1.50 pour of beer. Sadly, looking at some of the more recent reviews it seems like this may be the new norm here. We will be finding other local businesses to support during this time.

So I looked in the phone booth and I saw the re-bath and o thought you know let's give it a shot. I've never had someone come into my home and tell me what I can and can't do.. this was no exception. My sales clerk consultant person was named Ramon. I know this because my uncles name is Ramon as well. He came to our house and already had a thought for my bathroom in mind and the wife didn't seem to happy about it. We were spit balling ideas back and forth and then came the monetary amount.... basically how much do you have to spend. Which our reply was \"we want this done, but we aren't in a huge hurry.\" \"If the price is right we can move on it today.\" But the problem was that Ramon couldn't give us any type of amount that this might be. It almost seemed like even though we were still getting estimates from re-bath and others we still haven't decided what route we wanted to take. Ramon took pictures, took measurements and got all of our info...... and NEVER RETURNED. We waited for him to call back. I live by a strict motto... if I see I'm gonna call you back, I will. I should not have to go out of my way to call you so you can call me. Well either way. no new bathroom.

I got there ten minutes early for a 10am appointment. The stylist, Gina was 15 minutes late. I bought a Groupon for a basic Mani/Pedi but scheduled, in error, a shellac Mani/pedi (which I didn't realize at the time). Gina began by verifying what I was in for. I said a basic Mani/pedi (because that is what was on my Groupon voucher), but she insisted that I was wrong and that her schedule showed that I was in for a shellac Mani/Pedi (which is $40 more). I attempted to show her the Groupon voucher on my phone, but she waved me off with her hand and told me that I had made the mistake and, under her breath said, \"this is what makes me upset\". I wanted to walk out right then, but I had already bought the voucher. Gina never attempted to clear up the misunderstanding. Needless to say I was not happy. Getting a pedicure while you are mad at the person giving it, is an unusual experience. Neither of us spoke for the next 15 minutes. I didn't want to \"upset\" her any further for fear that it may change the way I was treated. After a little massage from the chair I was sitting in, I started to calm down and was able to engage in conversation. To be fair, Gina was very gentle and upgraded me to a shellac pedicure for no extra charge because she was out of regular nail polish for a French pedi. She seems like a sweet lady and she is good at what she does, but if there is a misunderstanding with a client (especially a first time client like myself), you want to make sure that you are not at fault...... and if you are, you apologize. She did neither. In either case, she should not worry who's at fault, but gladly except your customers patronage without showing a hint of frustration.

So, it was surprising that the food delivery had some annoying mixups and delays. Scallops seemed frozen rather than fresh and were not cooked right. They were covered with a vague and watery sauce. Pasta with it also had watery sauce. I had a salad that was large and tasty. Another person had pasta that really wasn't up to the standards of a genuine Italian restaurant.

My favorite for breakfast is the Cacao Warrior bowl, which when made right and when the fruit is ripe, is still very good.  But in this item, inconsistency seems to be a major problem.  Sometimes the bowl has been huge and other times extremely small and the proportions of ingredients blended into the bottom part always seems to be different.  One time this summer another customer got a bowl literally twice as big as mine at the same time as me.  I brought it up that my bowl was smaller than usual and instead of remaking it, they just added some more fruit on top.  A very nice gesture, but not the same as more acai blended in with coconut milk for the base.  I just let that slide.  Then the barkback app is never working either, except for the first time it was advertised as a frequent flyer benefit.  Today they told me to download the app on my phone and they would credit me for the visits I had missed.  When that didn't work (the app said they didn't have a loyalty card yet), the manager said he needed to talk to the upper management, but didn't offer anything in return.  \n\nThe icing on the cake was the Aztec steak bowl I ordered today.  It was a far cry from the original bowl I used to love, was not as advertised on the menu AND had a hair in it that was not mine!  YUCK! Instead of avocado was guacamole that was heavy on the cilantro, not a flavor that I like if it predominates.  Instead of cabbage was coleslaw - hello?! - not everyone enjoys mayonnaise on their fresh, healthy bowl.  Instead of bright quick pickled red onions as in the past, a ton of heavy wine (?not sure, but I'm not supposed to have alcohol) braised or poorly caramelized onions were substituted instead.  Finally, the beef did not taste like grass-fed as advertised and the quality was not as I remember it either.  All in all it just didn't go well together and felt very heavy.  Then after I found the hair, there was no turning back.  \n\nI called Goodness and spoke with Marley about this, who was really, really nice and refunded my money for the Aztec bowl immediately, so I'm adding one extra star for that.  Also, one star for the cacao warrior bowl when its good.  But with a name like goodness, I expect that to be all the time.  Really too bad because I love to concept - fresh, health and they support other local businesses, which is why in the past I'd tolerate their somewhat pricey menu, but after this experience I really don't think I'll be back.  I wonder if the management or ownership has changed hands or if after the expansion to skyline, they just can't keep up with the quality and consistency the way they used to."]], "date": "2016-12-05", "time": "22:23:38", "categories": "Juice Bars & Smoothies, Specialty Food, Food, Health Markets, Fast Food, Vegetarian, Restaurants, Salad", "city": "Tucson", "state": "AZ", "stars": 4.0, "business_review_count": 326, "predicted_review_score": 2.3999999999999995, "actual_yelp_score": 2.0}, {"review_id": "rO4TLcpTpr1nGGInmbHSJw", "user_id": "mJy-5ShuwwYRayxRtl6xxA", "business_id": "vr1I1RkSL-m6c-LCAd3O7A", "review": [["Ok, so the honest truth is that there's something about Hifalutin that makes me not want to like it.  I can't really figure it out.  Maybe it's the decor, it's just not my thing.  However, I find myself reasonably enjoying my meals every time we go.\n\nOn our most recent visit this weekend, we arrived pretty early, just about 5pm.  The place was dead.  By the time we left, there were a few tables, but it never really got very busy.  \n\nLet's start with the decor and atmosphere.  It's very dark inside the restaurant.  This could be ok -- romantic even -- but in a cowboy-themed restaurant, it's a little bit weird.  The cowboy theme is also weird in and of itself in Hifalutin.  It just seems a little bit forced.  The wait staff has to wear cowboy hats?  Meh.  The theme is certainly not winning me over, but whatever.\n\nThe menu isn't very large, but I think there's probably something for everyone who in general is ok with southwest-inspired food.  Think peppers and enchilada sauce.  There are some regular items, like sweet potato fries and potato skins, but mainly everything else has some sort of southwestern twist to it.\n\nI ordered the chicken tortellini pasta and my husband had the pot roast sandwich.  Before the meal even arrived, complimentary blue corn muffins were brought to the table.  I honestly think they're delicious.  They aren't overly sweet, but they're sweet.  They're always warm and fresh, which makes them super soft on the inside.  The outside remains crunchy.  The balance is great.  They come with some butter, but I don't personally think they need any.  \n\nMy chicken tortellini pasta was good, but not great.  It was a good sized portion of tortellini.  They were also on the larger side themselves.  They were cheese filled, but I didn't really taste much of that.  The chicken was shredded and kinda hard to see in the plate because it blended in with the cream sauce that was mixed into it all.  It tasted good and was tender, though.  The cream sauce was also good.  The dish was also topped with some of their red sauce, which was basically a thick enchilada sauce.  It was ok.  I think they should have mixed it with the cream sauce instead of putting it on top, though.  It was definitely better with the cream than on its own.  Overall, I would get this dish again.\n\nMy husband always orders the pot roast sandwich here.  He just really loves it.  I tasted some of it, and it is rather good.  The meat was very tender and very flavorful.  The bun it comes on had cheese baked into it, which was a nice addition.  It came with \"cowboy\" fries, which were seasoned steak fries.  Nothing special.\n\nOur server was very attentive.  We weren't without a drink at all during the meal.  She was happy to bring us more corn muffins and whatever other extras we asked for.  She was also friendly and personable.\n\nThe prices here seem ok to me.  The portions are large and the food is of decent quality, so I don't mind paying a little bit more.  We will definitely return to Hifalutin."]], "date": "2013-07-21", "time": "22:13:08", "categories": "Nightlife, Mexican, Barbeque, American (New), Comfort Food, American (Traditional), Sports Bars, Southern, Bars, Restaurants, Steakhouses, Breakfast & Brunch", "city": "Tucson", "state": "AZ", "stars": 4.0, "business_review_count": 239, "predicted_review_score": 3.3249999999999997, "actual_yelp_score": 3.0}, {"review_id": "lWYkMtzKLEgi6Ps8UrGmdA", "user_id": "S9X5mp9NVJTVAa6B3D_xXw", "business_id": "Uo-2rFQso6YVwTJkEsqtQg", "review": [["I found this barber for my boyfriend who had been bouncing around to various different places.

I've been a faithful customer for years and miss seeing \"Pancho\" the owner flinging hot wet towels to the customers with pinpoint accuracy from behind the sushi bar, well most of the time.  Now with Pancho moving on, the Oracle location is not nearly as good (in many ways) as it use to be.  Long waits for orders to be filled, wrong sushi presented because of careless chefs not reading the orders carefully, lack of  conversation skills of the chefs, excessive waits for beverages to be filled, etc.\n\nNow that I slammed the Oracle location, there's still light at the end of the tunnel.  The north location on the Catalina Hwy is a great second.  When there ask for \"Noel\", sushi chef extraordinaire.  I really mean it.  He's funny, friendly and loves taking care of his customers.  I think he learned his customer service skills from Pancho who he still sees from time to time.  Noel will even come up with some \"custom\" sushi if you ask him nicely.  This guy really makes the place come alive.  My wife and I love Noel's quality sushi and his personality makes it perfect to boot.   One last word about Noel, if he serves you as well as he does us, I recommend you leave him a gracious tip as a token of your appreciation.\n\nWe live in Goodyear, AZ and every time we drive through Tucson, we make a mandatory stop at Sushi Hama north for our \"sushi fix\".   Sadly we stopped at the Oracle location a few days ago thinking it was closer to I-10 and hence quicker to get back on the freeway.  We were wrong in several areas.  First with all the downtown exits being closed by ADOT for road widening, one has to take the \"scenic route\" from either south Tucson or Marana to get there.  No time saved at all.  Secondly, the extra time it takes to get to the north location is more than worth it in the area of quality and ambiance.  We won't make this mistake ever again.\n\nThe \"all you can eat price\" has gone up from $19.99 to $22.99, but its still a good deal for those who love sushi."]], "date": "2009-01-04", "time": "19:51:50", "categories": "Sushi Bars, Restaurants", "city": "Tucson", "state": "AZ", "stars": 3.0, "business_review_count": 82, "predicted_review_score": 3.0250000000000004, "actual_yelp_score": 5.0}, {"review_id": "aZsjbWA4ySluD565yj0Stw", "user_id": "u6nttZdZzshEsEvBA0o6EA", "business_id": "OxBZqeYH5xuusEPp9ml7-g", "review": [["I drive from Yucaipa CA, just have lunch here, then i wait a few hours and have dinner here too. need I say more.\nthe Sanora Dogs are a burst of mexico's street dog flavor, the asada tacos like no other.."]], "date": "2012-05-16", "time": "02:17:15", "categories": "Mexican, Hot Dogs, Restaurants", "city": "Tucson", "state": "AZ", "stars": 4.0, "business_review_count": 636, "predicted_review_score": 2.6, "actual_yelp_score": 5.0}]
